So, throughout the week, I was hoping to see as many new procedures as possible. Thank god I was able to wrap it up with some cool new procedures. One of the procedures among all really caught my eyes because it was unique. It was the varicose vein endovenous laser ablation.  The patient had varicose vein pain because her left leg veins were dilated (not the usual). Her varicose veins were kind of swollen and had a bluish color. Dr. Bui inserted a catheter into the varicose vein in the left leg so that the laser fiber can be advanced through it. For some reason, when the guidewire and marking catheter was being inserted, the patient was in pain, which is unusual. The procedure was guided using Ultrasound machine. Once the laser was inside, the ultrasound machine was used to check if the position was accurate. Then, the laser was turned on and the laser energy burns the lining within the vein, which causes it to shrink and thrombus the vein. As the laser was burning the vein walls, Dr. Bui was pulling down the laser fiber so that it burns everything as it makes its way down. This makes sure that all of the varicose vein is covered. This procedure closes the vein. I asked if it is life-threatening to close up a vein. He said not really. It is just one vein and since it was varicose, it wasn&#8217;t able to supply blood to the heart anyways. It was cool to see the light of the laser moving down the vein from outside the skin. Another problem that appeared to happen was that the tech couldn&#8217;t turn on the laser ablation machine. There was some problem with the machine or she didn&#8217;t know how to use the machine. So, they called for another tech to fix the problem. But, after about 15 minutes, she was able to fix the problem. Someone might have taken apart the parts of the socket that should be plugged to the machine and haven&#8217;t put it back the right way. This caused a delay in the procedure. It created inconvenience for everyone. So, it is important to put the machine back as it should be after the procedures are done. </p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to thank the clinical immersion faculty for giving me the opportunity to be part of this program. Shadowing the IR physicians and exposure to the clinical setting was one of the best experiences I have had in my life. I found my experience to be beyond any expectations. I am beyond grateful to have experienced and learned so much in such way. I would also like to thank our mentor Dr. Bui and other IR physicians for spending their valuable time teaching us. It was fun looking at everything in the hospital from an engineering standpoint. Also, everyone&#8217;s kindness and friendliness attitude in the clinical setting really made this experience invaluable, unforgettable and memorable. This is something I would never take for granted. I feel blessed to be part of this program because this is something an engineering student like me probably won&#8217;t get the chance of experiencing. I honestly can say I learned more than I would learn from pages of a book. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s over&#8230; I will definitely miss this. This is one unique experience that I will cherish for a long time. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been reading my blogs since the day one! Hopefully, you also were able to learn new things by reading my wonderful experiences in these blogs 🙂</p>

It would be a shame if I forget the full form of TIPS by the end of this program or ever in my life. TIPS has been the one of the most common procedures we have witnessed in the IR rotation. We started off our first few days with couple of TIPS placement procedures and we ended our clinical days with TIPS revision and TIPS reduction procedures. It&#8217;s like TIPS has come full circle. We got to see the entire cycle of TIPS over the past few weeks of our time in the IR rotation. TIPS placement is done on patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Thrombosed portal vein causes portal hypertension, meaning there is an increase in blood pressure in the portal vein. In order to create optimal pressure in the vein, a stent is placed between the portal vein and hepatic vein to reroute the portal vein blood flow into the hepatic vein. The stent allows normal blood flow, reducing the pressure in the portal vein. For the past 4 weeks, we saw many TIPS placement, where the physicians would place stent between the hepatic vein and portal vein to create the channel for proper blood flow. The stents have two parts: covered with PTFE and uncovered bare metal part. The uncovered part of the stent goes into the portal vein and the covered part is positioned in such way so that it starts from the front end of the portal to the hepatic vein all the way. We have seen TIPS placement procedure at least once a week. Then, this week, a patient came in for TIPS revision. This is another interesting part of the TIPS cycle. Even though we have seen multiple TIPS placement, this was our first time seeing a TIPS revision case. The patient had her TIPS placement procedure done in the middle of the June. She came in for a follow-up visit last week. The physicians noticed there isn&#8217;t any blood flow in the channel created using stent. The stent isn&#8217;t functioning properly. The physician couldn&#8217;t recognize the main reason of this issue from the images. So, TIPS revision procedure was important to investigate and plan accordingly.When they were able to access inside the vein, they measured the pressure. It was really high. Then, they decided to extend the stent in the hepatic side of the channel. Even after extending the stent, there wasn&#8217;t much blood flow. It was because of the blood clots in the channel and the portal vein, causing blood flow to impede. Then, they decided on doing a portal vein lysis procedure on her the next day. This procedure was quite interesting because we haven&#8217;t seen anything like that before. The physician placed a lysis catheter (shown in the picture below) in the thrombosis vein so that it can administer a thrombolytic agent called TPA directly into the clot. The lysis catheter was kept inside to deliver TPA continuously over the night. </p>
<p><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Unifuseillustration.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Unifuseillustration-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a></p>
<p>The lysis catheter was really cool because it has bunch of holes at the end of the catheter, which is placed into the clot. All the small holes on the catheter allows TPA to enter into the thrombosis vein, aiding with dissolving the clots. Then, the next day, they brought the patient down again to see if the lytic agent worked or not. It turned to be really effective. Even though the clots were mostly dissolved, the stent still weren&#8217;t able to function properly. Then, the physician ended up extending the stent in the both ends of the stent. They placed 3 stents in total inside the original stent, overlapping one another. </p>
<p><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19718418_1571919279505087_1666543797_o.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19718418_1571919279505087_1666543797_o-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a></p>
<p>When they extended the stent at the portal vein, they placed a uncovered stent. They place uncovered portion at the portal vein to allow blood flow from the collateral veins to the portal. The extended side of the hepatic vein was covered. I was really mesmerized when I saw placement of 3 stents inside one. One of the questions I remember asking was that &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t insertion of 3 stents overlapping with other stent causes thrombosis of the stent?&#8221; The physician said, &#8220;no&#8221;. He said when they place the stent, they place it against the wall of the original stent, leaving no space in between the stents. Another problem he mentioned is that overlapping the stents to extend may cause them to slip off from one another, which could be life-threatening. This was a really interesting TIPS revision case. The patient had to go through a lot. However, after extending the stent, the result was just beautiful. It was so satisfying to see the stent working properly at the end. </p>
<p>Another part of the TIPS cycle that we were able to witness was the TIPS reduction procedure. TIPS reduction is done on a patient when there is too much blood flow in the channel between hepatic vein and portal vein using stent. Too much blood flow can be toxic for the body. That&#8217;s why narrowing the stent is the ideal treatment approach. So, TIPS reduction is really important to limit excessive blood flow through the stent. <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19748025_1571919342838414_947845752_o.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19748025_1571919342838414_947845752_o-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="101" height="101" /></a>As shown in the picture below, the physician inserted a small bare metal stent in the middle of the original stent. Then, he deployed another stent, which has the same size as the original stent. Also, it was covered as the original stent. Once the covered stent was deployed in the stent, the small bare metal stent was expanded to its nominal diameter. Since bare metal stent is stiffer, it can push the covered stent inside, reducing the diameter of the covered stent. This decreases the blood flow and reduces the portal vein pressure. Honestly, this method of reducing the diameter of the stent seems like not the best option. By deploying a stent with thicker wall (smaller in diameter) can solve the exact problem without having to deal with 2 different stents at the risk of slipping out of one another, which can be unsafe.  By observing all these procedures, we figured that the stent has to be malleable in order for it to be fit in the artery. Also, the stent should be covered with the kind of material that doesn&#8217;t cause it to slip out from the other stent. Firmer interior grip would be ideal for the issue. Stents are so important for many procedures in the field of IR. There is a definite need for improvements in stents. I am glad that we got to see from placing the stent to revising and reducing of the stent in this short time period. It feels so good to learn so much from this experience. I cannot believe it&#8217;s coming to an end. Looking forward to ending the week with more interesting cases and more learning opportunities. </p>

These tumor board meetings have been always engaging with interesting cases. This is where the specialties from different departments come in to discuss the treatment options for complex cases and agree on the best route to treat the patients with complex liver diseases. One of the cases particularly  made this week&#8217;s tumor board really interesting. So, this patient has lung cancer and possible liver cancer. The patient came in first with lung cancer issues. He had additional problems. Then, the IR physicians looked at the CT, MRI images of the patient. They noticed he has tumors in his liver as well. When they noticed tumors in the images of the liver, they thought it is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a type of liver cancer. So, they performed a liver biopsy procedure on him to make sure it is what they think. They sent the samples to the pathology department so they can examine the samples of liver tumor tissues more closely. One of the pathologists came to the meeting to discuss about their finding and their insights. So, the pathologist pulled up a slide with the images of the microscopic view of the tissue samples. By looking at the cellular structure of the samples, they determined that the tumor is benign. She said they believe it is hepatocellular Adenoma (HCA) based on the samples. HCA is a very rare kind of liver tumor. The IR physicians were like what? It was kind of clear to them that it is HCC. The pathologist was like maybe you guys didn&#8217;t get enough samples. She was implying that there could&#8217;ve been some sampling issue. Things got heated a little bit in the room. There were some disagreement between the results from the pathology and imaging. The lady from pathology kept explaining about HCA. She was saying HCA can turn into HCC in future. It&#8217;s not certain but could happen. She was suggesting to &#8220;act upon it soon&#8221;. But, IR physicians don&#8217;t treat tumors that are benign. They would treat it if it was HCC for sure. There were some arguments on how to go about this issue. Patient had lung cancer. But, when the pathologists examined the lung tumor samples, they found the tumor to be benign as well. That was kind of weird. I think later on, they decided to do another biopsy to see the result again. It was really interesting to see that pathology results can differ from the MRI images. Also, the way everyone provided input to the discussion by giving their opinion was really impressive. </p>

It is the third most common cause of cancer related death worldwide. Over the past few weeks, we have seen multiple ways to treat liver cancer in IR using different methods, skills and technologies. One of the most common procedures to treat liver cancer that we have observed was the transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Today, one of the liver cancer patient was treated using TACE. In this procedure, the doctor basically uses catheter that delivers embolization beads into the blood vessels in the liver. These beads are infused with chemotherapy medicine. Basically, the beads block the blood vessel to prevent blood flow to the tumor. Then, the chemo agents are released from the beads, which then kills the tumor over time. Today, when the doctor was done inserting the catheter into the blood vessel, he noticed that the chemotherapy embolization beads haven&#8217;t arrived yet. That&#8217;s a problem. The patient has catheter inside of him already but the chemo wasn&#8217;t ready. The doctor came out of the OR room to call the people who are supposed to send the beads by 10:20 am. When he called them, he found out that the order of chemo wasn&#8217;t placed until today in the morning. However, apparently, IR department ordered it yesterday. There was some miscommunication. According to Chemo people, it was ordered in the morning and they were going to send it by 11:30 am. After knowing, the procedure has already started, the chemo people decided to send it by 11:10 am. Because of this miscommunication, the procedure got delayed. Other procedures were pushed back. It caused inconvenience for everyone. </p>
<p>Previously, we have seen other ways to treat liver cancer such as radioembolization where radioactive particles are inserted to kill the tumor cells. Today, we saw a completely new procedure to treat liver cancer. This procedure is called ablation. This procedure uses heat to destroy the tumor cells. The device that is used to tailor ablations is called the neuwave medical ablation system. This system has multi-probes (3 probes in total). For this case, they called the neuwave medical inc. representative to assist with this device during the procedure. I was talking to the rep. She said this device is pretty new to the market. It&#8217;s a 4 year old company. This device is really effective at covering large, multiple tumors. Before this they had single probe system. Also, radio-frequency ablations were more common than microwave frequency waves. The patient had about 3 tumors in his liver. So, this device was ideal for the procedure. The benefit of having multi probes is that if there are 3 tumors in an organ, all of them can be destroyed simultaneously by placing 3 different probes at the different spots of the tumor. Also, if the tumor is huge, the 3 probes can be activated simultaneously, which creates high, consistent temperature and large confluent ablations. This is possible because all the probes are connected to a single generator, which produces in-phase waves. Also, the procedure with this device is much faster than single probe system. In single problem system, repositioning of the single probe and ablating multiple times in order to cover the tumor completely make the procedure longer. Basically, one end of the probe is attached to the generator and the other end of the probe is inserted into the liver (at the site of the liver tumor). Then, current with microwaves frequency is passed through the probe to the body, which generates heat that kills the tumor cells. Before they used to use current with radiowave frequency. But, microwave ablation is much safer and effective at ablating than radiowave frequency ablation. I asked her what is the maximum frequency a doctor is allowed to apply? She said there is specific FDA regulations for it. For example, doctor cannot apply 65 watt frequency for more than 10 minutes. It has to be for 10 minutes or less. The max frequency that can be used is about 145 watt frequency for certain amount of minutes. So, they are really restricted on how much they can apply for how long. It shows that because of FDA regulations, there is limitation in freedom of using the product you developed the way you want. So, when developing a product, you have to be aware of the fact that your freedom of using the product the way you want might be limited by the regulations imposed by the FDA. </p>

But, you know what&#8217;s funny? We haven&#8217;t went to the CT scan room until this week. We always see CT scan images on the computer and observe how doctors analyze these pictures to determine the disease or the treatment before going into any procedures, however, We never got to see how these images are taken until now. Also, this was our first time seeing a CT guided lung biopsy. There was a control room outside the procedural room with CT scanner. The patient had a tumor on the surface of his lung. Lung biopsies can be challenging because you don&#8217;t want to puncture the lung by accident, causing air leak and lung to collapse. In this case, it was less risky because the tumor wasn&#8217;t inside the lung. It was on the surface of the lung. I noticed that every time the physician needed to scan the body to see if their needle is at the right position, they would take 5 images in each run. One of the things that bothered me the most was that every time the physician needed to see the images, he would have to come out of the procedural room and come to the control room where there is a monitor displaying the images. I thought that made the procedure extremely slow and risky. Imagine you are making something out of clay in one room, but the picture of the object you are making is on a different room. You would have to go back and forth between the rooms in order to make the accurate design. That would make you slow and less precious right? That&#8217;s how I felt about this CT guided lung biopsy. The doctor had to come to the control room multiple times during the procedure. After seeing the images, he would go inside the CT scanner room and fix the direction and the angle of the needle going into the patient&#8217;s lung. He would have to remember in what angle/direction the needle should be inserted in after seeing the image. I was like &#8220;how did he do that without having the images in front of him?&#8221;. They are experienced doctors. So, they do it very smoothly. But, honestly, I thought the lack of real time image in front of the doctor made this procedure slow and a bit risky. I actually asked the doctors why don&#8217;t they just include these screens with CT scan images inside the CT scanner room? He said you are right. It would be ideal. But, this is an old CT room. That&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t have it. But, the new CT scanner rooms do have screens.  </p>
<p>In this week, we were lucky enough to meet two awesome medical device sales representatives. One lady was from cook medical Inc. Another lady was from gore medical. Both of them were so friendly and enthusiasts about teaching us about their devices. The lady from cook medical came to educate the physical assistants and nurses on their new device called Retracta detachable embolization coils, which is used for artery and venous embolization. It was so cool. The tiny detachable coils has synthetic fibers. The design itself was great. It is also retractable. She taught us how to place and retrieve the Detachable coils using catheter. After that, she pulled out couple of filters that are used for vena cava. She let me use the placement and retrieval device to deploy the filter and retrieve it as well. I was so happy that she let me do it.  She showed us two different filters, which are tulip and celect. Both are for vena cava. They are just different versions of ivc filter. She told us the advantages and disadvantages of each filter. </p>
<div style="width: 90px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19340032_1553016371395378_1778112667_o.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail " src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19340032_1553016371395378_1778112667_o-80x80.jpg" width="80" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tulip (left) and Celect (right)</p></div>
<p>She mentioned the cone-shaped design concept of the filter came from oil pipes. Celect is newer version of ivc filter. The tulip filter&#8217;s design wasn&#8217;t effective enough because it would tilt inside the vessel pretty often. When it tilts, it makes it difficult to remove from the vessel and cannot filter properly, which makes it a short term filter. That&#8217;s why they came up with the new filter called celect, which is much better than the tulip filter. Its improved design helps to prevent itself from clogging. Also, she mentioned that celect is not made out of nitinol, which makes it better because the legs of the filter won&#8217;t fracture. It was really an informative discussion about devices. </p>
<p>The next day, Dr. Gaba was nice enough to bring us a box of different devices from his office so that we can look at them. We noticed couple of cool filters, stents and closure clips. One of the things that drew our attention was this uncovered stent because when you squeeze the stent, the stent&#8217;s length and diameter both changes. The stent basically elongates each time you press on it. We asked him about the stent. He said it is called wall stent and used for TIPS procedure. He continued to say, &#8220;we don&#8217;t really use that anymore because we use covered stents for TIPS now, which is so much better than wall stent&#8221;. The covered stent is basically a metal stent covered with PTFE material. He asked us why do you think covered stent is better than wall stent for TIPS? Then, he said, &#8220;Since wall stent elongates, it is not precious enough.&#8221; Covered stent don&#8217;t elongates. So, it can be placed on the desire spot accurately. These stents are placed in the liver. Liver produces bile. They are thrombogenic, meaning they promote clots. Covered stent does a very good job of preventing bile from entering into the artery, prevents blood clots. That&#8217;s why covered stents are widely used nowadays for TIPS procedure. However, these covered stents aren&#8217;t the best stent. Over time, they may clog. That&#8217;s why Dr. Gaba was mentioning that it would be cool to have stents that are self-reporting in future. The stents that are able to report if it&#8217;s narrowing or clogging. It was really fun to talk about these devices and their advantages and disadvantages. </p>

That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s always something new to learn while shadowing. On Tuesday, I was lucky to witness another interesting procedure called radioembolization of liver tumor. The patient has tumor in the liver. In order to thrombus and kill the tumor, embospheres contained with radioactive isotope Yttrium-90 (Y-90) were injected through the hepatic artery, since this artery supplies blood the most to the tumor. These bead-like spheres are about 30 microns. These spheres block the artery, causing to block the blood supply to the tumor. Once they are at the site of the tumor, these emits high dose of radioactive beta particle and delivers it to the tumor. These beta particles cause the DNA strand of the tumor cells to break, meaning the cancer cells cannot replicate anymore, which causes these cells to die. Because these embospheres contained radioactive particles, they were handled very carefully. A health physicist had to come for the procedure, who brought the embospheres with her. When it was time for the insertion of the particles inside the body, it was placed in a container inside a small square glass shield. Basically, the doctor didn&#8217;t touch the medicine. There was a catheter, whose one end was attached to the shield and another end was inside the patient&#8217;s body. Using a separate catheter, pressure was introduced to the container inside the shield, which caused the spheres to move up the another catheter that goes into the body. The procedure was really interesting. I also noticed the health physicist was carrying a radiation scanner. she was scanning the room. When we got out of the OR, she scanned all of us to see if there was high radiation. That was different compared to the all the procedures we have seen so far.</p>

<p>I remember asking Dr. Gaba if the catheters they used for the procedure was specially made to deliver radioactive particles. He said, &#8220;no, they are like the regular catheters&#8221;. He said they don&#8217;t really use special catheters for these particles because they never really exhibit huge risks unless there&#8217;s a leak in the catheter. But, later he mentioned there is deterministic risk and stochastic risk associated with radiation exposure. If there was a beta shield catheter for radioactive particle embospeheres, it would be awesome because the beta shield catheter can protect anyone in the OR from the stochastic risks. The idea of inventing beta shield catheter sounds great me! </p>
<p>Another procedure called mesenteric angiogram was done on the same day. The patient&#8217;s bowel is bleeding. So, they were doing the mesenteric angiogram to determine the source of bleeding in gastrointestinal tract. Since fluoroscopy takes images within few seconds, they were having trouble seeing the source of bleeding. The bleeding wasn&#8217;t occurring continuously. That&#8217;s why the images taken in seconds weren&#8217;t helpful at all. They kept taking images until they find the GI bleed. Unfortunately, they couldn&#8217;t due to the fast fluoroscopy images. If they could take images continuously for 15 minutes, it would be easier for them to determine the GI bleed. </p>

Right after the discussion, we followed Dr. Lipnik to an OR to observe bilateral uterine artery embolization procedure. I was wondering why the patient needs to get the procedure. The physician explained that the patient was bleeding a lot during menstruation due to uterine adenomyosis disease. Adenomyosis occurs when extra tissues grow within and into the walls of uterus. This extra tissues causes excessive bleeding. He said embolization is not the greatest procedure to treat this. The patient has 50:50 chance to get treated entirely. For this procedure, there were 2 surgery tool tables. First, I didn&#8217;t understand why they needed two surgery tables. This was my first time seeing that. Later on, I realized in one surgery tool tables, they put the drugs for embolization and in another table, they put the all the other equipment. The procedure called bilateral uterine artery embolization because the the embolic agents were distributed in both sides of the uterus. The physician inserted small bead-like embolic agent into the artery with contrast. The bead like agents are called embospheres. They mix the embospheres with contrast in order to see where the spheres are going. The embospheres are so small like 500 microns. Basically, the embospheres goes into the arteries and then advances into the capillaries and then blocks the end of the capillaries. Capillaries provide nutrients and supplies blood to the extra tissues inside the wall of the uterus. By blocking the capillaries, the physician is able to block blood supply/flow to the tissues, which helps to prevent the tissues from growing. I thought this procedure was super cool because I could see the embospheres and where they going. The application of the embospheres within the body was super fascinating to learn about.</p>

<p>During the procedure, I noticed a work-around that caught my attention. The physician needed  CO2 to insert into the patients body. So, a tube coming from the CO2 cylinder needed to stay on the surgery tool table. So, the physician used a fabric bandage to put it around the tube in order to make sure it doesn&#8217;t fall off the table (as shown in the pic below). </p>
<div style="width: 90px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19024708_1543516845678664_596112510_o-1.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19024708_1543516845678664_596112510_o-1-80x80.jpg" width="80" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bandage used to stick the tube onto the table</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Later that day, we have been to couple of procedures where catheter was placed inside the body for different purposes. For one patient, the physician inserted a trifusion catheter for chemo therapy purpose. I saw the catheter has 3 inputs. Each inputs is used for different things. One input is to draw blood and other two inputs were to give two different drugs. Using Ultrasound and fluoroscopy, this procedure was executed. The catheter can stay inside for weeks or even months. We also saw the procedure of tunneling the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tissue on the chest wall  for dialysis purpose. This catheter had two inputs for in flow and out flow of blood. Also, Dr. Bui mentioned this catheter is cuffed closer to the inputs, meaning it has adhesive section on the catheter in order to hold the catheter in place. That was pretty interesting. Also, the cuff section helps during removal as well. </p>
<p>After that, we saw a percutaneous renal biopsy. Even though we saw this procedure before. But, this time I got a chance to talk to the cytologist. When I asked him what&#8217;s the minimum amount of tissue sample do you need to do the testing, he responded that they need minimum of 15 glomeruli you need. But, he aims for 20 glumeruli just to be safe. Glumerli are the tiny units in the kidney where blood is cleaned. After that, Dr. Bui went through some concepts with us such as why delivering chemo through a chest port more ideal than delivering it through the IV way. </p>
<p>On Thursday, we went to the multidisciplinary tumor board meeting. In the meeting, they talked about different patients with complex issues. They talked about this liver mass biopsy patient&#8217;s treatment options. Basically, the doctors couldn&#8217;t see the mass in the CT image. But, there is a mass. When everyone heard about the case, one of the physicians suggested to repeat MRI at the end of the June to access for internal growth of the mass. They also talked about couple of other cases; all the cases were interesting and complicated. Later that day, we observed a hepatic artery embolization procedure. The purpose of the procedure was to insert oil based contrast in the hepatic artery so that they can see the masses/tumors a lot better and clearly. This helps a lot when they come to treat the patient later because this procedure is basically marking the masses for the latter doctor to treat the mass.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we were able to see the placement of chest port procedure on a patient. We had been hearing about chest port a lot. So, it was nice to see the procedure in person. The chest port  has a reservoir compartment with a septum attached on the top. The septum is like sealing membrane, where needle is inserted each time there is a need for delivering any drug. Also, a catheter is attached to the port, which helps to deliver/spread the drug into the body. We saw how the physician inserts the chest port entirely under the skin in the chest. This procedure is the most infection resistant compared to the catheters. That&#8217;s why chest port is an ideal approach to deliver drugs inside the body. </p>

<p>For the rest of the day, we went over couple of cool devices in Dr. Bui&#8217;s office. Every single device was so different and unique. It was fun and enlightening. I really enjoyed learning about the devices, their applications, advantages and disadvantages of each device. It was just a perfect end to a perfect day! </p>

We started off with a liver biopsy procedure. Previously, we have seen liver biopsies. But, this time, the liver biopsy was performed using a different approach. Previously, we observed percutaneous liver biopsy, meaning the tissue samples were taken out of the liver by puncturing a hole on the skin right above the biopsy site (liver) using a biopsy needle with ultrasound guidance. However, this time, we observed Transjugular liver biopsy. Dr. Bui explained to us that there are three different ways to do liver biopsy. One approach is the percutaneous way with image guidance (ultrasound) or landmark (eye balling and guessing where the liver is). Another way is the transjugular liver biopsy using the transjugular pathway to access into the liver. The third way was open cut surgery. He said it&#8217;s very rare that physician use the open cut surgery method to do biopsy. It&#8217;s only done when the patient is already having open cut surgery for something else. He also mentioned that transjugular liver biopsy is the best one out of the three because it exhibits the lowest risk. If something goes wrong during transjugular procedure and the vessel bleeds, the blood goes back into the system. We noticed that the procedure for transjugular liver biopsy is really different than percutaneous liver biopsy because of the difference in pathway. Since the procedure itself is quite different, the needle for transjugular liver biopsy is a lot of different than the percutaneous liver biopsy needle. The needle used in transjugular is inserted using a curved sheath with a stiffening and guiding metal cannula and the sheath is inserted through the transjugular artery into the liver to collect tissue samples.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another interesting procedure we observed is TIPS. Last week, same procedure took about 5 hours to complete, however, this time it only took about 2 and 1/2 hour. This could be due to anatomy of the patient or the physician&#8217;s skill. This procedure was to create a new connection using metal stent which has two parts-2 cm of the stent is uncovered and the rest is covered with a net-like cloth. The tunnel is between the hepatic vein and portal through the liver. I noticed that the physician used a marking catheter that has a pigtail in order to determine the length of the stent. The length that they measured is basically the length of the covered part of the stent, not the entire stent. I looked the packaging of the stent. It shows that the uncovered part of the stent is always 2 cm long, while the covered part of the stent is varied depending on the patient&#8217;s anatomy. After finding the portal vein, the physician inserted a stent that was 8 cm long (covered part). The marking catheter was inserted again to check if the placement of the stent was appropriate. They noticed the stent needs to be shorter. So, later, they used a 5 cm long stent. Basically, the uncovered part of the stent is placed into the portal vein and the rest covered part is the channel from the end of portal to hepatic vein. It was pretty cool to see how the stent was released into the liver. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another case that I found really fascinating was the placement of Inferior Vena Cava filter. Basically, a catheter is inserted into a vein and advanced through the IVC in the abdomen. A IVC filter is attached to a catheter which is pushed over the guide wire and once the IVC is placed on the correct position, the filter is released. The filter is then expands and gets attached to the walls of IVC. When I saw the release of the filter, i was blown away by the amazing design of this filter. Later on, when we talked to Dr. bui and Dr. Gaba, we found out that the filter does an okay job. It&#8217;s not the best.Dr. Bui said &#8220;it&#8217;s not as filtering as you would think it to be&#8221;. They both mentioned that the filter is able to block big clots, not small clots. Dr. Gaba stated that the filter can penetrate the blood vessel because it has sharp hook like ends. Also, the actual filter itself can get clogged. There is a room for improvement. But, they said it does a good job at blocking the large clots. So, it&#8217;s alright. It was interesting to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of the IVC filter. </p>

<p>Thursday was another interesting day at the hospital, with lots of different procedures. Around 6:45ish in the morning, I showed up and changed into scrubs quickly. In the IR office, Dr. Bui, the fellows, the residents sat down to discuss about the patients and when and which procedures need to be  done on them and who would be attending which case for the day. We showed up early morning to be part of this meeting and get a sense of the workflow of the department. Right after the meeting ended, we followed the team to a conference room, where we got to witness a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting. In the meeting, couple of PhDs and couple of experts in different medical specialties were present to discuss about complex patients&#8217; cases and approaches to treat them. It was pretty interesting to see the importance of teamwork in the medical field.</p>
<p>After the tumor board meeting, we joined a fellow who was about to start the chemoembolization procedure for hepatocellular carcinoma. This procedure was really fascinating; like I always hear about chemo for cancer and stuff but I never had the chance to witness anything like this. That&#8217;s why I was really excited. Anyways, the doctor first started with an angiogram to locate the blood vessel that is the closest to the liver tumor. There were 3 tumors in the liver. It was a challenge to deliver the chemo medicine to the tumor that was the furthest to the blood vessel. Basically, the doctor used a catheter to deliver the drug to the targeted tumors. I noticed that it was quite a challenge to get the guidewire to the correct location of the desired blood vessel.  It took a while, but the procedure was successfully done. During the procedure, I noticed the injector was being used gave warning to &#8220;disconnect the patient from the injector&#8221;. This issue was addressed by the operator of the injector. </p>
<p>Next, another cool and challenging procedure just blew my mind away. This was the most interesting one of the day. This procedure is known as the transjugular Intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. This procedure is important to reduce pressure in the portal vein. Basically, a mesh like shunt is placed through the liver to connect the hepatic vein to the portal vein. This procedure lasted for 5 hours. The difficulty was finding the right vein to connect the shunt to. There&#8217;s so many branches of the vein. That&#8217;s why finding the right vein using the guidewire was quite a challenge. After standing for 2 hours straight in the OR, we got tired of standing. Our feet started to hurt. So, we left the OR. I seriously don&#8217;t understand how do they have so much patience and energy! Oh my goodness, props to them!</p>
<p>Since we left after a while, we couldn&#8217;t see the end of the procedure. However, we got to see the Superior Vena Cava intravascular mass biopsy. The procedure was similar to the liver/kidney biopsy we saw before. This time, the samples were taken from the tumor in the blood vessel. Dr. Bui mentioned that it was kind of risky because while performing the procedure, if the tumor moves down/moves at  all, the patient might even die. But, he was able to do this without any problems. He is just awesome! He told us to check out the biopsy needle and we were playing around with it to see its mechanism. It was pretty cool to learn how the biopsy needle works!</p>
<div style="width: 184px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18944643_1536737463023269_349976202_n-1.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail " src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18944643_1536737463023269_349976202_n-1-80x80.jpg" width="174" height="174" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Learning how Biopsy needle works.</p></div>
<p>Later that day, we observed the attempted procedure of declotting of LUE AVF and the placement of chest tube on another patient. Then, the  day ended with debriefing with Dr. Bui. It was quite a long day. We were there for 9 and 1/2 hours, but it was definitely worth the learning. </p>
<p>On friday, we came around 9 am-ish. Dr. Bui had a meeting till 10. We tagged along a fellow. We observed another paracentesis procedure. When Dr. Bui came back we went to see a clinic patient. This patient was supposed to get a Thyroid nodule biopsy that morning, but wasn&#8217;t able to due to unspecific order of the test. So, what happened was the hospital&#8217;s scheduling system&#8217;s order for test wasn&#8217;t specific. They didn&#8217;t specify it was a thyroid biopsy with genetic testing. That&#8217;s why they will have to come back again. There is a room for improvement in the thyroid biopsy scheduling process. </p>
<p>There was a patient who came back after removing kidney stone. Dr. Bui noticed that there were still some stones left behind to be removed. We observed the procedure of removing the nephroureterostomy tube and placing a ureteral stent. Then, we saw another tumor related biopsy. It was the Neck mass biopsy. The doctor used a different biopsy needle compared to the ones we have seen before. The needle and the device was smaller than the other biopsy needles. (see the picture below)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> It was interesting to see the different sizes of needles used  for different biopsies. Also, the technique of storing the sample was different compared to the kidney/liver/SVC intravascular mass biopsies. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another day passed by very quickly, involving bunch of exciting things! Just loving it this experience already! </p>

<p>On wednesday morning, I woke up a little bit earlier than I needed to be because of the exciting  anticipation of the day ahead of me. Also, I wanted to reach there on time. Once I got there around 8 am, I saw my fellow teammates in the waiting room, waiting for our mentor, Dr. Bui, to take us to his room. As we were waiting, we were observing the waiting area and thinking about the things like human-centered design methodology that we talked about in the clinical immersion workshop on Tuesday morning at the Innovation Center. We were seeing if the waiting room was user friendly enough. Was it boring or Was it able to provide entertainment to engage the patients? The waiting room had several things to save patients from boredom. They had engaging arrangements for patients of all ages. It was kind of funny how we were just talking about this on tuesday and was able to relate to it the next day. Thank god for the TV news. Before even starting the day, I learned a lot about the world, especially about the Trump&#8217;s infamous tweet! </p>
<p>Around 8:50 am, a nurse came and directed us to Dr. Bui&#8217;s office. We introduced ourselves to Dr. Bui. He was really nice and friendly. Right away he told us to get scrubs and changed into them. I was like Yes! Scubs! So official! (of course, in my mind).  After putting on the scrubs, my work mode was on. He told us to put on shoe cover, masks and caps because we were going to an OR to observe Paracentesis procedure. The procedure was guided by ultrasound because the doctor needs to see the abdomen in real time.  Basically, this procedure is done to remove fluid called ascites. Ascites builds up in the abdomen for different reasons such as liver disease or portal hypertension. In the operating table, there were one syringe, needle to take out the fluid, bottles to collect the fluid. Depending on patients, the amount of fluid withdrawn from the body may vary. We observed this same procedure twice on two different patient. Three vials of fluid was collected from one patient and a huge bottle of fluid was collected from another patient. This was a pretty interesting procedure. </p>
<p>After that, we observed nephroureterostomy tube (aka nephrostomy tube) for stone access procedure.  This procedure is done before planned surgical PCNL the next day. This procedure is so coool!!!! I had no idea that you need to get this procedure done by IR before getting your kidney removed. You learn something new everyday! This day, I felt like I was learning something new very hour! I was just really enjoying learning new concepts and procedures. Oh, almost forgot to mention, before they performed any procedure, they do this time out thing to make sure the correct patient, procedure and everything. Anyways, this procedure creates an external drainage for renal collecting system. For this procedure, Ultrasound, previous CT scan and X-ray were used. The  nephroureterostomy tube was inserted around the kidney stone and advanced into the bladder. This procedure minimizes the injury to the kidney. Several ways kidney can be removed. Shock wave couldn&#8217;t be used in this case because stones were large. That&#8217;s why it was important to insert the  nephroureterostomy tube to remove the large stones from the kidney the next day. I noticed in most procedures, they use smaller needles to pierce through the skin/membrane rather than a scissor to prevent big holes in the patient&#8217;s body. In this procedure, a directional wire and directional catheter was used. The guide wire is very important to navigate the catheter to the right place.  The catheter goes over the wire in order to slide over and inserted to the directed site. In this case, it was kind of difficult to put the guidewire around the stone due to the anatomy of the patient. But, the procedure was successful at the end. It was really fascinating. Also, Any procedure involving X-ray always required us to put on lead apron for protection. So, we did have lead apron on. Honestly, this thing weighs more than me &#x1f641; </p>
<p>After Lunch, we looked at another case where the patient needed to Renal Biopsy procedure to be done. It was completely different than the other two procedures. I was exposed to the Biopsy needle for the first time. In this procedure, the doctor basically extracted tissue from the renal. It was a small needle. He injected the needle 4 times to collect the amount of tissue samples needed. I was curious why did he use small needle when it took him 4 tries to get enough sample rather than using a big needle and get all the samples at once? Thinking to myself, maybe they don&#8217;t have bigger needles. I asked Dr. Bui about it. He explained that smaller needles are better when it comes to biopsy because then he can get samples from 3 different places reducing the sampling error. Bigger needles = higher sampling error. He performed another Kidney Biopsy where he used 18 gage needle. It was interesting to learn about the importance of using different sizes of needles. In Dr. Bui&#8217;s office, he went over some concepts such as Seldinger Technique and like when IR was innovated. The background information that he provided was extremely helpful to understand the procedures. </p>
<p>Later that day, we went to see two clinic patients. Dr. Bui was informed that one of the patient&#8217;s percutaneous drainage catheter has a leak. That&#8217;s why Dr. Bui and we went to check up on that because that doesn&#8217;t occur often. Dr. Bui had a feeling thing that there might not a leak. When we went there, the doctor realized the issue wasn&#8217;t the leak. The catheter wasn&#8217;t capped right or it could be defective. Another patient was in 7th floor. We took the stairs. Oh man, that was a good work out! ( After 5th floor, I was dying. That&#8217;s how you know I am not fit&#8230;) When we entered the patient&#8217;s room, we noticed there was coal in the room. Later, we discovered that it was to prevent room from smelling. Anyways, for this patient, the doctor attempted US guided bedside abdominal drainage. On our way back from there, we were discussing about the features of the abdominal drainage tube. This tube has a loop where it has couple of holes (see the picture provided).  The holes are basically designed in the loop so that nothing gets clogged up. One thing Dr. Bui mentioned that the tube isn&#8217;t optimal because it cannot drain everything. I think we asked why there aren&#8217;t more holes on the tube&#8217;s pigtail. He said &#8220;because too many holes cause it to lose its integrity&#8221;. Yah, that makes sense! </p>
<p>Overall, day 1 at the IR department was just mind blowing. One thing I have to mention, medical terms were a big challenge for me. Thanks to my M2 teammates for helping me out with that. But, I really enjoyed learning so many new things!!!! This is just the beginning of my journey to discover new things! I am excited and looking forward to working and gaining more knowledge from everyone involved in this program! </p>
