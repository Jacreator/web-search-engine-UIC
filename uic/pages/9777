    <p> The  College of Business Administration is a research-based institution located in  the heart of Chicago that cultivates a spirit of entrepreneurship through  real-world experience. The  University of Illinois at Chicago College of Business Administration was  recently ranked No.1 among Chicago-area schools and tied for 56th overall among  accredited undergraduate business programs by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. <br />
      <br />
The ranking places UIC among the top 15 percent of the 467 programs accredited  by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the  primary accreditation organization for business schools. Over 2,200  undergraduate students annually pursue majors in six areas: accounting,  entrepreneurship, finance, information and decision sciences, management, and  marketing. UIC&rsquo;s proximity to the urban business community in Chicago affords  substantial opportunities to stay connected with the pace of business issues  throughout a student&rsquo;s educational experience.</p>
    <p>The undergraduate  program offers a diverse student body and access to rigorous programs that  develop the skills necessary to become the business leaders of the future. The  breadth and depth of the faculty and the quality of their research and  scholarly work are evidenced by publications in the leading journals in their  fields. The rigor of the curriculum and the faculty&rsquo;s research interests have  led to the development of honors business courses and a leadership academy. In  addition, the college has established excellence in teaching as a primary objective.  Students will be joined by a group of peers whose diversity of backgrounds  significantly enhances the learning experience and exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>In  addition to course work in the major area, the curriculum includes core  courses in all functional areas of business, and supporting course work  in mathematics, communications, statistics, and information systems.  This program allows CBA graduates to go on to pursue management and  leadership positions in business and nonbusiness settings, or start and own their own businesses. The undergraduate program provides students with the skills necessary for 
              a successful career in business and is also an excellent 
    preparation for graduate training in business, law, or any business-related discipline.</p>
    <p>The  College of Business Administration provides leadership in the creation  and transmission of knowledge as one of the largest and best  undergraduate business programs in the Chicago area. This outstanding  education is enhanced through high-quality graduate programs, academically challenging and innovative theoretical and applied research, active professional  development programs, and an array of research and outreach centers.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

  </span>All entering freshmen in the college must successfully complete  BA 100&mdash;Business Administration Orientation during the fall semester. BA  100 is a one-semester-hour course required for graduation. This  first-year experience course is designed to help students successfully  transition from high school to a university environment. BA 100  includes an introduction to study strategies and techniques as well as  an orientation to resources available at UIC. Students will be given an  overview of the CBA majors and careers in business. Students will  complete a group project and presentation on a career path in business.  Additionally, this course provides ample opportunities to connect with  other students, faculty, staff, and organizations and activities on  campus. </p>
  <p><br />
    <span class="clsSubHead3">Foreign Language Requirement<br />
  </span>The College of Business Administration requires at least two years of a  single foreign language in high school with minimum grades of C as a  criterion for admission. Students who are admitted with a deficiency in  this area must take two semesters of a single foreign language at the  college level with minimum grades of C or prove proficiency in a  foreign language.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">General Education Core<br />
  </span>General Education at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for  lifelong learning. Students are required to complete a minimum of 24  semester hours in the General Education Core with at least one course  from each of the following categories:</p>

  <p>For a description and a list of courses for each  General Education Core category, students should consult the <em>General  Education</em> section of the catalog. Information on meeting  the General Education requirements for each College of Business  Administration degree program is detailed in the previous section on  General Course Requirements.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">General Education Proficiencies&mdash;University Writing  Requirement</span><br />
    A minimum grade of C in English 160 and 161 is a degree requirement.  Transfer students who have taken the equivalent of English 160 and/or  161 at other institutions may only receive graduation credit for these  courses if they earned minimum grades of C.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Mathematics Requirements<br />
</span>Business students must register for a 
  mathematics course every semester 
  beginning with their first semester of 
  enrollment until one of the required 
  mathematics tracks has been completed. 
  After completing the required math 
  courses, students must enroll in IDS 270. 
  Some students may be required to take 
  prerequisite math courses prior to 
  enrolling in the required math courses. 
  Credit earned for these prerequisite 
  courses will not count toward the hours 
  required for graduation, and the grades 
  earned are not included in the grade point 
  average (GPA). Students may place 
  anywhere in this sequence: MATH 075, 
  090, 125, 165, and 180. Satisfactory grades 
  are required in MATH 075 and 090 to 
  progress to the next math course.</p>

  <p><span class="clsSubHead3">Course Work Limitations<br />
  </span>Courses that duplicate previous course work do not count toward  graduation, nor do courses in which failing grades are received.  Furthermore, credit earned in the following courses does not count  towards graduation: Business Administration 100 and 289; English as a  Second Language courses; English 070 and 071; Mathematics 
  075, 090, 118, 121, 140, and 141; kinesiology and military science courses; and foreign 
  language  courses taken to fulfill a deficiency in the CBA foreign language  additional graduation requirement. The only exception is that students  may earn 3 semester hours of credit in English 070 or 071 and a waiver  of English 160 if written authorization is received from the Department  of English. BA 100, BA 289, ESL courses, MATH 075, MATH 090, and  Academic Skills Program courses do not carry academic credit and will  not be used in computing the grade point average, but will be used for  the purpose of determining full- or part-time status, and for financial  aid eligibility.</p>

  </span>In addition to meeting all University requirements for the degree, students must earn a minimum cumulative GPA of  2.00/4.00 in each of the following to qualify for graduation: (1) all  courses taken at the University of Illinois at Chicago; (2) all courses  (UIC and transfer) counted toward the degree; and (3) in the major.</p>
  <p><span class="clsSubHead3">Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate/Degree  Completion<br />
    </span>The College of Business Administration is  dedicated to assisting students with the achievement of both their  academic and professional goals in a timely manner. One semester before  graduation, CBA students must meet with their academic advisor to  complete a graduation check. When students register for their final  semester of courses, they will also declare their intent to graduate  online using Student Self-Service. The deadline to declare graduation  in the <em>my.UIC</em> system is the end of the third week (fall  and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which  graduation is sought. Failure to complete these  two steps may delay the awarding of the degree to the next semester. A  final review of the records will be made following the close of the  term.</p>
  <p>Students completing all degree requirements for their declared major will need permission from their college to enroll in additional undergraduate courses. See online 
    catalog <a href="https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/catalog/GR.shtml">https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/catalog/GR.shtml</a> for a complete description of this policy.</p>
  <p class="clsSubHead3" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Enrollment Residence Requirement </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The following college enrollment residence requirements apply to all CBA students:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Once  a student has reached junior standing (earned 60 semester hours of  college credit), he/she must earn at least 60 additional semester hours  at an accredited four-year institution. The college and department  enrollment residence requirements must also be fulfilled.</li>
    <li>The  last 30 hours of course work must be taken in enrollment residence at  UIC. Furthermore, at least 30 of the 60 semester hours in the Business  Course Requirements section of the curriculum must be taken in  enrollment residence at UIC. </li>
    <li>At least two-thirds of the credit required for a departmental major must be completed at UIC.</li>
    <li>Concurrent  attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another  collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at another  institution, when approved by the student&rsquo;s college, does not interrupt  the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="clsSubHead3"><em><strong>Ethics Requirement</strong></em></span><br />
    All students are required to demonstrate    understanding of business ethics through
    completion of an online ethics examination.<br />
    </p>
  <p><span class="clsSubHead3"><em><strong>Assessment Requirement</strong></em></span><br />
    To ensure the quality of the academic    program and to assist in continuous    improvement efforts, all students must    participate in one assessment event prior    to graduation. Students will register for a    non-credit course (BA 395) to complete this requirement.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="clsSubHead3"><em><strong>Computer Requirement</strong></em></span><br />
    Business students are required to have a    laptop computer that can run the latest    versions of Microsoft Windows and Office    and has Wi-Fi or Wireless internet access.  </p>
  <p><a name="i" id="i"></a><span class="clsSubHead">College Policies</span></p>
  <p><a name="j" id="j"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Academic Load</span><br />
    To be considered a full-time student during the fall and spring semesters, a student must be registered for a minimum  of 12 semester hours. For Summer Session 1 (Four-Week) and Summer  Session 2 (Eight-Week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester  hours as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time enrollment.  A maximum of 18 semester hours may be taken in a semester (12 hours  between the two summer sessions). To complete a CBA degree within four  years, a student must take an average course load of 15&ndash;16 hours per  semester. Students requiring prerequisite math or English courses  should plan to attend summer school to ensure timely graduation and  meet this goal. For each hour of registered course work, students should expect to complete three hours of homework, studying, and reading.</p>
  <p><a name="k" id="k"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules</span><br />
    Students&rsquo; academic status will be based on their semester or cumulative  grade point average. Students are in &ldquo;good standing,&rdquo; &ldquo;on probation,&rdquo;  or &ldquo;dismissed.&rdquo; Students can check their academic status after each  semester on<em> my.UIC</em>.  Students who are on academic probation or who have been dismissed are  informed of their status by UIC email from the college following the end  of the semester.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Probation Rules</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Students will be placed on academic probation in  any term in which they earn either a cumulative or semester grade point  average of less than 2.00/4.00. They will then be expected to earn at  least a 2.00/4.00 semester grade point average and to raise their  cumulative grade point average to a 2.00/4.00 to achieve good academic  standing. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Academic probation at UIC can only be removed by 
    successfully completing additional course work at UIC. Probation is broken down as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The following rules are applied to determine the academic status of a student on probation: </p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>A  student in good academic standing is placed on semester probation for  any semester in which less than a 2.00/4.00 GPA is earned, but the UIC  cumulative GPA is 2.00 or higher (Warning Status). </li>
    <li>A  student in good academic standing is placed on academic probation in  any semester in which the UIC cumulative GPA falls below a 2.00/4.00. </li>
    <li>A  student currently on academic probation is continued on academic  probation (unless dismissed from the University) until both the  cumulative GPA and the UIC GPA are raised to 2.00/4.00. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>CBA  Undergraduate Programs determines the conditions of probation. In  addition to specifying the grade point average, the college may require  the completion of specific courses, limit the number of hours for which  students register, and exclude students from taking certain courses  while on probation.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">All students on probation  are required to adhere to the following terms of probation (academic  restrictions). Failure to do so will result in registration holds and possible academic dismissal.</p>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Students  must meet with their academic advisor to complete an academic contract.  The contract will include any requirements and/or restrictions for the  student&rsquo;s next semester. </li>
    <li>Students must  schedule an appointment with their CBA academic advisor two additional  times during the semester to discuss their academic progress for the  term. </li>
    <li>Students cannot register for more than 12 hours of course work for the semester (6 hours during the summer term). </li>
    <li>Students  must seek tutoring in their weak subject areas, i.e. math, accounting,  economics, statistics, etc. Tutoring is available in the College of  Business Administration Undergraduate Programs Office, during the fall  and spring semesters, the Honors College, the Mathematical Science  Learning Center, as well as many other support programs on campus. </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="clsSubHead3" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Dismissal Rules</p>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
    <li>If a student is on academic probation,  the student may be dismissed in any term in which he/she fails to meet  the grade point average required by the probation status and in which  the cumulative grade point average in courses taken at UIC is less than  2.00/4.00. </li>
    <li>If a student is on academic  probation, the student may be dismissed in any term in which he/she  fails to meet the grade point average required by the probation and in  which the combined transfer and UIC grade point average is less than  2.00/4.00. </li>
    <li>If the student fails to make  any significant progress toward a degree, the student may be dismissed  from the college, and is therefore ineligible to enroll at the  University in subsequent semesters. </li>
    <li>The  student may be dismissed in any term in which he or she fails to comply  with the conditions set by the College of Business Administration. </li>

  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Undergraduate students may drop courses using <em>my.UIC</em>  through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring  semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday  of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring  semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer  Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2) students may drop  courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs  between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on  the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall  and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer  Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 
    UIC individual courses that result in a W notation 
    on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To avoid difficulty, CBA suggests that students do the 
    following:</p>
  <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Meet with a CBA academic advisor each semester to plan a manageable course schedule and stay on track for graduation. </li>
    <li>Get feedback from their instructors before the drop deadline to determine if they are succeeding in their classes. </li>
    <li>Give careful consideration before using this option early in their academic career. </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="m" id="m"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Change of Major/Declaring a Major</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students are encouraged to discuss their options for majors within the  College of Business Administration with faculty, career advisors, and  academic advisors. CBA students must declare a major by the end of their sophomore year. Declaring or changing a major is done by making an appointment  with an academic advisor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="n" id="n"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Class Attendance</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">CBA&rsquo;s expectation is that students will attend  all classes because it is necessary for achieving academic success.  Each instructor may establish specific attendance requirements for  his/her course. The instructor is responsible for making the  attendance policy clear to the students. An instructor cannot drop a  student from a course due to nonattendance. It is the student&rsquo;s  responsibility to make certain that all courses are added and dropped  properly by the published deadlines.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="o" id="o"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Closed Courses</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Courses close because a maximum enrollment capacity is placed on each  course. This limit cannot be exceeded due to safety and environmental  regulations. It is necessary that students register at their assigned  time to ensure the preferred course schedule.</p>
<p><a name="p" id="p"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">College Level Examination Program (CLEP)</span><br />
    The College of Business Administration accepts a maximum of 30 semester  hours of CLEP (College Level Examination Program) credit toward the  degree requirements. Examinations may provide credit if approved by the  college. CLEP credit will be awarded toward the CBA degree requirements  based on the description and content of the exam, permission from the  college, and the score earned on the exam. A minimum score of 65 is  required. The CBA does not accept CLEP for English composition or  foreign language credit. CLEP exams are administered on  campus by the Office of Testing Services at (312) 996-0919.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="q" id="q"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Course Prerequisites</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students must meet all course prerequisites. The most 
    up-to-date prerequisites for courses are listed on <em>my.UIC</em>.

    Undergraduate Credit</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">The College of Business Administration prohibits undergraduate students  from registering for graduate-level courses and the use of  graduate-level credit applied toward the undergraduate degree. Students  should understand that graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate  student are not applicable toward a future graduate or professional  degree.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="u" id="u"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Independent Study</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students are required to contact an instructor in  their major field of study to propose a topic for independent study. If  approved, a Request for Independent Study Form  must be completed and approved by the academic department before  registering for an independent study course. In addition, if the course  is to be applied toward the major, a formal petition must be approved  by the department head and the Undergraduate Programs Office of the  college. Students should consult the department office for specific  procedures regarding enrollment in 
    independent study courses. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="v" id="v"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Petition Procedure</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students who want to make formal requests or appeal college  policies do so by using a petition process. The CBA has various types  of petitions available for different types of appeals, requests, or  clarifications of policies and requirements. Petition forms and advice  for completing these forms are available in the Undergraduate Programs  Office in 1118 UH or on the CBA website <a href="http://business.uic.edu/ugrad-advising">http://business.uic.edu/ugrad-advising</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="w" id="w"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Proficiency Examinations</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students interested in earning proficiency credit should contact the  department for information concerning eligibility and availability of a  proficiency exam. This is subject to the University, college, and  departmental policy on proficiency examinations. Proficiency credit  cannot be earned by CBA students for major-level courses, nor can  proficiency credit earned for a foreign language be used towards the  degree. A student who earns proficiency credit is given the amount of  credit toward graduation regularly allowed in the course. Proficiency  credit is not considered an interruption of the enrollment residence  requirement, nor a satisfaction of the last 30-semester-hour enrollment  residence requirement for graduation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="x" id="x"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Required Advising for Registration Approval</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Each semester, all Accounting majors, who have started taking  major-level accounting courses, are required to meet with an academic  advisor and an assigned faculty advisor in their major department prior  to receiving approval to register. Students on academic probation must  also meet with an academic advisor prior to registering for the next  semester. Registration holds will not be removed from the student&rsquo;s  account until these conditions have been met.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="y" id="y"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students may repeat a course to increase their  knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which  repeating a course is advisable and to a student&rsquo;s advantage. There are  also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a student  and narrow a student&rsquo;s options. The College of Business Administration  requires students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their  academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>
<p>Courses  with A, B, or C grades may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades  may be repeated once with written permission. In all cases, the  original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear  on the transcript. The original grade will be calculated into the grade  point average, unless the student initiates a request for <em>Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation</em> as described below. Only one registration 
    for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.</p>
  <p>To repeat a course more than once requires written 
    permission from the student&rsquo;s college. Students who 
    have  been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat  courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult  their college before repeating a course.</p>
  <p class="clsSubHead2" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="y" id="y2"></a><span class="clsSubHead3">Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Important Note</strong>: Grade point average recalculation for a repeated course <strong>is not</strong> automatic. The student must initiate a request in the college office as outlined below.</p>
<p> For the grade point average recalculation policy to apply, a student must   declare to his or her college the intent to repeat a course for a change of   grade. Students must submit this request to their college before the end of the   official add/drop period, no later than the second Friday of the fall and spring   semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of   Summer Session 2. The  course must be repeated within three semesters of the receipt of the  original grade, and it must be taken at UIC. Only one registration for  the course counts toward the total number of credits required for  graduation.</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students are allowed  grade point average recalculation in up to four repeated courses. Under  the course repeat policy, all courses taken and their grades appear on  the transcript in the semester in which they were taken. Under the  grade point average recalculation policy, the grade earned the first  time the course is taken will be dropped from the calculation of the  cumulative GPA and the grade(s) earned when the course is repeated will  be used in the calculation. This rule holds, even if the second grade  is lower than the first. If a course is repeated more than once, the  first grade is not counted in the GPA, but all other grades for that  course are calculated in the cumulative GPA.</p>
