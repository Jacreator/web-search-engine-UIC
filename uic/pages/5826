        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <i>Graduate Student Petition</i> 
          (sometimes referred to as the general petition) is to be used by students 
          for most requests of exceptions to policy and rules. Some examples include 
          late course adds and drops (along with <i>Graduate College Registration 
          Revision Form</i>; see <a href="RegRevInstr.html">Instructions</a> for 
          <i>Graduate College Registration Revision Form</i> for when the <i>Graduate 
          Student Petition</i> is necessary), extension of time to complete the 
          degree, extension of probation, extension of time to complete and incomplete 
          (I) grade. It should <b>not</b> be used for late registration (attempts 
          to register after the registration period is over if you are not in 
          any hours), transfer credit, leave of absence, and university withdrawal 
          (drop all courses for a term), as these actions have individual forms.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students should provide clear 
          and concise statements for what is being requested along with relevant 
          rationale. The <i>Graduate Student Petition</i> requires advisor (or 
          instructor, if appropriate) and Director of Graduate Studies signatures, 
          and justification of their position. (Nondegree students do not need 
          the Director of Graduate Studies signature - nondegree students should 
          write &quot;nondegree&quot; on the lines in that section).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once a decision is made by 
          the Graduate College a copy of the form will be mailed to the student 
          at the address provided on the form.<br>
