I think that’s on the faster end, usually doctors can’t get through that many patients. In total that morning, the doctors got through 17 patients in the 4 hours of the morning. I didn’t track how many doctors/nurses, so this isn’t very meaningful.</p>

In general, I get the feeling a lot of patient knowledge comes from Googling stuff at home.</p>

Dr. Neiderberger was only briefly in the room to observe and give pointers, but it was entirely done by the residents. I took more careful time notes to keep track of time. Setting up utensils took 10 minutes, preparing patient before call-out took 20 minutes, more materials prep for another 10 minutes, and then the procedure started 40 minutes after starting set-up. I noticed an excessive number of people in a cramped area. Of the 5 people in a tight space near the man’s groin, 1 was a tech who helped pass out the utensils to the fellows, 2 were fellows doing the surgery, 1 was a resident to help with the watering syringe, and 1 nurse collected samples. I think 3 of those roles could’ve been done by 1 person (utensils, watering, sample collection). I met Dr. Shapiro for the first time, and he confirms the stereotype of Urologists being funny surgeons who make inappropriate jokes. I noticed suturing took by far the most time – 56 minutes in total. Some of this might’ve been slow due to training, but it’s remarkable how no one complains about this. Instead, I heard Dr. Bakare complain about the microscope adjustments required between users, which seemed to take at most 2 minutes per resident/fellow. I also noticed you can’t touch the large arms of the microscope because it is not sterilized – only the microscope part at the end and its handle arms are sterilized with the plastic-bag looking items around it (pic attached of Dr. Bakare almost touching the arm part).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On Friday, I saw a vaginoplasty sex change from male to female at UIH. It was remarkable to see Dr. Schechter take the skin from the man’s penis and form a vagina out of it. In the surgery room, it all looks believable, but when I stepped back to think about what we’re doing, it was incredible to take it all in. I asked Dr. K what happens when the patient feels gender dysphoria after surgery. He didn’t quite know the answer and said that’s what the surgery is meant to address. Dr. Schechter said there is often some depression post-surgery but no significant gender dysphoria.<span>  </span>For the first time, I saw the recovery room. It is just a separate room where we roll the patient and keep them there to recover with nurses assisting. I wondered if these procedures are covered by insurance, like Medicare/Medicaid, and Niki confirmed they are. Supposedly, these surgeries are most common in Iran despite the conservative religious culture, because it is done as a corrective measure (or maybe castigation?) for homosexuals. During the surgery, the skin of the penis needs to be plucked of all hair follicles so that it’s not hairy when re-inserted as a vagina. This looked tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I asked about clinical needs, Dr. Schechter mentioned the need for better retraction tools. They use a bunch of surgical instruments/scissor-looking clip devices to hold together sutures and keep the surgical area open without tying up people’s hands. Dr. C from Urology at UIC supposedly invented a suturing sewing machine device and won a prize for it, but Niki doesn’t know where it has gone since then. I hope I can speak to him about his progress on it. When speaking to some nurses, I also noticed them complaining about inefficient employee assignment. Nurses on flex were not on call during an overtime period, but the full-time nurse was being held overtime instead (they noted she probably gets paid higher and doesn’t want to be there overtime, so it’s a waste keeping her on call instead of the flex nurse).<span>  </span></p>

Often, the doctors will get back to their computers and in the commotion of collaborating and addressing short-term needs, they forget to make the order for the patient who they just spoke to.  The lab might eventually call when the patient shows up to ask what’s going on, but at that point, a lot of time has been wasted and the patient may be suffering as a result of their waiting. In response to this problem, we propose a voice transcription system that takes existing dictation software on phones and creates a note on the doctor’s desktop post-dictation so that they have a reminder to order and won’t forget at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In clinic Tues/Wed, we noticed a few more interesting cases. A Chinese man with high PSA walked in but we didn’t have clear info from his 20-page or so referral from his primary care physician. As a result, we sat there for about an hour in total just trying to figure out why he was in the office. Even with the translator, it was a huge struggle. Fortunately, his wife spoke decent English and cleared things up for us. Still, our time was probably tripled due to the language barrier. When reading through his referral packet, we searched for PSA levels due to the benign prostate hyperplasia consult, and after 3 of us searching thoroughly for about 15 minutes, we never found it. It’s a common problem that doctors are searching for 1 or 2 key facts from these packets amidst a lot of pages, and often never find it. We ended up having to call their office to get the information, which begs the question of why we have these huge referral packets in the first place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another issue we noticed when clearing the urine from a man’s catheter was that the urine jug can’t stand on its own. I’m not supposed to be stepping in as a helper, but the nurse and doctors often need me to do simple things like hold something in place. In this case, Nurse Nadine needed an extra hand while she used both of hers to open the tube for urine to leak out. I had to keep the jug steady. Only when the jug has urine can it stand on its own. This seems like an annoying problem that should be easily fixable.</p>
<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;--></p>
<p>In regards to Nadine spending lots of time writing letters, we asked her what notes she would most value if there was a template. She showed us the return to work/school form (pic attached) and showed us how the EHR lets you autosave some text in as a template. In this way, you can type up a sample letter for the patient and leave blanks where appropriate. We are considering writing up some short templates for work/school and embassy permission to speed up the typing process for Nadine.</p>

There were no issues, but I noticed sewing up the man’s incisions after surgery takes a long time. Usually, the doctors leave and let the residents do it. It took Niki around 30 minutes to finish up the suturing. I wonder if any portable sewing machine-like devices exist that could make this easier and faster. Essentially, they take a wire and snake it through both ends of the incision that they want to seal tight, just like with any sewing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Surgery equipment checklists are a validated benefit, but I see it done inconsistently. It was done for the next Urolift surgery with the nurses checking that they had a kit and the Urolift box for surgery, but still we ran into the most time-consuming problem I’ve seen yet in the hospital. The Urolift box comes with the clipping tool to clip the prostate lobes but not the metal extender that actually enters the urethra, so UIC puts it in a separate kit. The nurses never did this surgery before and didn’t know which kit to get, so they accidentally got a similar but wrong one. The metal tool was too short, so we had to ask equipment offices to get a new one. It took no longer than 5 minutes for them to confirm they have one and are bringing it, but it took 45 minutes for them to bring it up for some reason, so we just waited around. Niki said we did the checklist at the beginning (called a ‘time-out’ – pic attached), but they don’t thoroughly check every kit and every material to make sure they have every item. They’re satisfied just knowing the box is in the room. In this way, the checklist system was flawed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another huge problem that day was that someone accidentally tossed a culture sample from surgery.<span>  </span>Apparently, the nurse marked in the computer that she has it and has sent it before sending it. She then forgot to do it, and someone tossed it. Even if she did send it, there’s no step along the way to confirm it’s been properly transported and received. Without a confirmation and flagging system along each step of culture transport to the lab, it seems easy for this to happen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On a side note, I’ve felt personally that the face masks are very annoying. I can’t see behind my head, so it’s hard to tie the straps and takes about a minute each time, and everyone’s required to wear it in the OR. During surgery, if it comes off, you need to get someone to help you tie it back on (I helped Dr. Garvey get one of his straps back on).<span>  </span>I feel like Velcro straps would be way more convenient.</p>

Ben, Shana and I agreed that patient education regarding bladder removal/prostate cancer, inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) design, ureteral stent design, and patient turnover in OR rooms were some of the most frequent and biggest issues that we want to address. We found it interesting to hear the pulmonary team talk about inhaler device use problems. By coincidence, we are interested in patient education more generally and find that inhaler technique is a common issue for patients. We wonder what sorts of solutions might work: better handout materials, take home videos, how-tos over text, or anything else.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was sick on Tuesday but came back to the Mile Square clinic on Wednesday. I saw a patient using the IPP for the past 2 years with no success. He was upset and felt his urologist in Indiana did not properly do the procedure. The IPP didn’t wrap properly around the glans, but Dr. K said this is a common complication and not a mistake on the part of the surgeon. The patient appeared very disappointed and frustrated, claiming he got divorced, though Dr. K didn’t believe him. Nurse Nadine says it’s common to see wives leave due to erectile dysfunction.  Regardless, the man didn’t seem to have much say in choosing the IPP originally. Dr. K gave him two options: fix the IPP so it wraps around the glans and improves erections or remove it and give him a malleable prosthesis instead. I could tell the man had in his mind this idea of a botched surgery (Dr. K was offering the man a 3<sup>rd</sup> opinion), and wanted someone to redo the surgery properly. Dr. K didn’t give that option and finally explained that he’d probably want the malleable. It seemed like a pretty spur of the moment decision where the patient just trusted Dr. K. I wonder if complications could have been explained earlier so the man could’ve understood his options earlier.</p>

<p>A Polish man with glioblastoma and kidney problems came in and needed a virtual translator. We had a pretty nifty monitor video system set up (pic attached) so that a translator could see and talk to him. It was a good communication exchange, but I’ve noticed that phone exchanges are much worse. The translator doesn’t know if the doctor is just making a quick comment or actually wants the comment to get translated. With multiple people in the room, it gets confusing, so the video facilitates better communication because everyone can see each other.</p>

A nurse during the first surgery pointed out a few problems she runs into with the saline bag cart. Basically, there’s a large warning notecard that lies between the hooks, and when the button is clicked to raise the bags on the hooks, the bags get caught on the notecard and rip up, causing all the fluid to fall out. She said this has happened to her a few times. A radiation surgery was scheduled to obliterate kidney stones, but as they went in to find the stone, they couldn’t find it. A large X-ray machine was operated by a tech person and Dr. Abern had to regularly call out “spot,” after which the tech would hit a button to take an x-ray. They checked whether their uteroscope was properly inserted by double checking these x-rays to make sure they didn’t puncture through the ureter, which supposedly is quite common. Once inside the kidney, they couldn’t find the kidney stone, and said it might’ve gotten scooped out when they removed the stent. I was surprised that there’s no confirmation they removed the stone besides not being able to find it with the uteroscope.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On Friday we saw a prostatectomy with Dr. Abern, Tony, and Niki. Niki helped explain the actual procedure to me as they were cutting past the bladder to the prostate. When removing the prostate, a lot of care was needed to avoid the large arteries, external and internal iliac, and nerves in the area. I heard robotic surgeries might increase risk of cancer spreading, and Niki denied it. The nurse and Niki told me that the trochanter arms on the DaVinci often smack the doctors in the face as they’re working. <span> </span>I asked if the range of motion is limited by all the arms in the way, and Niki said it’s usually not an issue – you can just switch to another arm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our first Monday after shadowing was presentations and group exercises. I noticed Interventional Radiology and our team both recognized difficulties identifying things on MRI/CT scan due to black/white imaging not being clear enough to identify some organs. We did group brainstorming of how observations fit into categories, and our peer practice interviews were a fun practice for when we do the same on our rotations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday, we were at the Urology clinic at Mile Square. There were 26 scheduled patients, way less than the 37 last week. 6 were no-shows, and 6 were seen/complete by 11 am. Nadine, a nurse, told us how important it is to start a new patient with good notes, because later all the doctors are relying on that to get a baseline understanding of the patient. Sometimes, the team forgets to make prescription orders. The lab calls later because the patient shows up, but I imagine there might be times when both sides forget. It looks like residents/fellows take patients first-come first-serve and initial their name on the list of patients so the others know who’s taking that one. Occasionally, I hear grumbling about taking a patient based on their condition or because the resident remembers them being annoying last time, but besides that, it seems like an unbiased fair system of patient assigning. I’m curious if there’s evidence of improved outcomes for randomized patient assignment, but I think it would slow down workflow because no-shows and longer-than-expected visits would screw up any pre-assigned ordering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first patient was angry because he came to see the doctor twice, and both times Dr. K was out, and he’s got to miss work each time. He claimed to Nadine that he never got a stent procedure and refused to talk to anyone besides Dr. K. When Dr. K showed up and spoke Spanish with him, his demeanor completely changed and he admitted more symptoms. Nadine says you can note “only wants to see Dr.” in the patient notes so we know to only schedule him when the doctor is in. I imagine this can become a problem if it’s a pattern, because Dr. K can’t see everyone everytime. Plus, it might create longer periods between visits to fit them in the schedule, which might exacerbate their conditions.  Wait times listed on the EHR seem to be underestimates. A lot of patients walk up to us and complain they’ve been waiting too long. The team uses MRIs on CDs the patient gets from their primary care physician. One almost didn’t work but after about 5 minutes of tinkering on the computer, we got it loaded up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A patient with erectile dysfunction half-jokingly gave the idea of a remote-controlled penile prosthesis. The IPP has high satisfaction, but we noticed it’s pretty hard to pump, and a remote control would probably make things easier. Dr. Abern uses myprostatecancerrisk.com, which is supposedly a validated website, to justify biopsies. Nadine takes a long time to write personalized letters for patients explaining medical excuses or embassy permission so that their family can come visit them. She says she doesn’t do templates because each case is pretty unique, but I imagine I could come up with a general enough letter that could be useful. UIC does not use phone media, only mail and pamphlets for patients, but they’re hoping to work on it in the future. I asked Dr. Abern about if he can point things out remotely on daVinci, and he said there are dual control robots but they weren’t available that day in surgery.  </p>
<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;--></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Shana, Ben, and I split up, with me staying at Mile Square. A man had no visible blood in urine, but some amounts were detected microscopically, so the man could have prostate cancer. It could’ve been easy to overlook it because he doesn’t see the blood, but when we found out his wife is a smoker, we realized it’s important to always ask and test. One man says his appointment was at 9 but our computers said 9:45 so he was waiting for an hour. Jelena schedules surgery appointments when anesthesia is involved. She says, understandably, patients often miss appointments for non-invasive, diagnostic procedures, but show up for cancer surgeries. She often gets finance phone calls and has to email Pat, an insurance lady in Indiana. It’s a problem because Pat has no phone number, so Jelena can’t refer patients to her directly. She isn’t allowed to talk about side effects and dangers of no-shows, but she says repeatedly calling people is pretty effective at making them come. She can tell by the tone of their voice whether they care or not about the appointment. I also learned that when medicare doesn’t cover Viagra, we use a cheap generic, sildenafil, from a California compounding company. Having read a bit about the insane patent protection practices on drugs, I wonder how people make generics and how they get approval to sell them in hospitals. The saddest part of the day was when a lady with a long history battling cancer was told her urethra was clear, but she needs CT scan and cystoscopy, because a cancer might be elsewhere in her urinary tract. She reluctantly agreed only to a delayed test because she didn’t want to hear any bad news. Dr. K and Dr. Niki spent about  10 minutes trying to persuade her to do the test before she finally agreed.</p>

We immediately noticed it was quite fancy and swanky. The men’s changing rooms were a bit cramped. The first surgery was a varicocelectomy, with FSH/LH levels around 16, way above the threshold of 4.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After wheeling him into the surgery room and putting him under the anesthesia, the residents shaved his hair. There weren’t enough chairs so they brought one in. They must attach to these large black pads sideways from the table so that the residents/doctor and have arm support as they’re working. I noticed before Dr. Neiderberger walked in that everyone seemed a bit worried about what might make him upset. Dr. Bakare insisted it was just kindness for others, but I suspected it had to do with him leading the surgery. They had to undo all the straps around the patient when Dr. N said the patient was about 1.5 inches too high. They unstrapped him, pushed him down the bed a little further, and re-strapped him. I wondered why they didn’t use the button to lower the bed level. Dr. Bakare was too short to properly maneuver the big head lights on top, so someone helped her. There was no space on the tables for Dr. N’s laptop and camera, so they had to clear stuff up. The anesthesiologist put a large inflatable air bag over the patient’s head. Dr. N mentioned in a past surgery the lights failed, so now they do light checks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I noticed just set up for surgery (sterilization, placing sheets, strapping patient) takes a long time, at least an hour, though they weren’t in any rush. When scrubbing in for the surgery, you can’t touch anything in the room before getting your gloves and lab coat on, so I imagine it’s easy to accidentally contaminate and have to re-scrub again. Also, you need someone to help you with your gown so that the part you touched with your hands gets covered up as you tie up your gown. We were told to watch out for the wires on the ground sticking up a bit, because we might trip. They placed lines with a marker on the patient’s stomach where they wanted to cut. I wondered if they used permanent marker and what happens if they make a mistake. Do they have erasable markers? As the surgery started, the anesthesiologist kept her hand on the green air bag to monitor patient breathing and checked vitals once in a while. She had a lot of downtime and spent it doing a crossword. I noticed Dr. N get a little frustrated when they wouldn’t get him the right utensil during a particularly tricky, time-sensitive position. Clear communication was important. I also noticed Dr. N’s hands shaking when using the microscope – maybe because the microscope distorted his vision and orientation. The second surgery was testicular sperm extraction and went much faster. The anesthesiologist places tape over the eyes to prevent the cornea from drying out, which I thought was a pretty neat, easy solution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On Friday, I watched a prostate surgery with a daVinci robot by Dr. Abern. The patient had to scooch from the rolled-in bed to the surgery bed, which looked a little difficult for him. The anesthesiologist had to keep a mask on him tight around the mouth with both hands, leaning back with her back to hold it tight. She got worried because she switched to intubation but forgot to switch off the ventilator because it was in the back and the switch is not easy to see. Another doctor came in and showed her what happened – she says this happens occasionally. She also mentioned that patients without teeth are sometimes harder to intubate/ventilate. I overheard the doctors talking about a recent case complication where a pubic vessel and artery got mistaken for one another because there weren&#8217;t clear landmarks on the body. I overheard Dr. Abern mention this a couple times during our surgery as well. I wonder what doctors do in tough-landmark cases. They were missing a razor in the room and had to go get one. While chatting with me, the doctors talked about how some random people will walk in to the hospital with no credentials and start interviewing people or sometimes to steal babies, which I thought was crazy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I learned the scrubbing process is very specific. You must wash both your hands, then use your back to push the door open, otherwise your hands might be contaminated by the door. I noticed a ‘Stryker’ on-site vendor specialist for machines in the room. I wonder what he does and if he’s in the room for all surgery set-ups. Setting up took about an hour, the same as yesterday. When cutting open the stomach, the doctors/residents used metal clips to pull on the sides of the cut – it looked like it could be somewhat annoying. After another 45 minutes of surgery set up, they pulled up the da Vinci robot and spent the next 3 hours cleaning out adhesions. Apparently, this guy had so many surgeries in the past, that adhesion connections formed and they had to spend 3 hours removing them. During surgery, nurses had to replace the arms of the robot with the necessary utensil. Once they finally got to the prostate and found the cancerous part, they cut it with some tools and used this cool internal bag system that bagged the cancer and sucked itself dry around the cancer. The nurse told me they remove the bag last at the end of the surgery. I noticed the doctor having to point to a monitor next to the resident using da Vinci. He occasionally had trouble explaining the angle he wanted him to point the cutter or probe with his fingers. I wonder if you can draw on the screen like ESPN to show the person on da Vinci on their screen where to probe/cut.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These first few days of Clinical Immersion have been eventful. Day 1 at the Innovation Center was introductions to our new teams and discussions of what to expect.  I am in Urology with Ben and Shana. We talked about design and went through examples of hospital waiting room designs. Seeing waiting rooms with activities for children and iPads was nice, but most of us agreed these things are probably too expensive for hospitals. I also think it’s a problem of hospital management time and prioritization. When building a hospital, CEOs probably find a mentor/advisor who built a successful hospital and copy their actions, including the building blueprint and interior design. Going back after the fact to renovate individual hospital sections might be low priority compared to managing insurance, for example. A <a href="https://archive.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/hospbuilt/index.html">2005 study</a> looked at hospital design effects and frictions, and they found that, among other issues, there is insufficient compelling evidence of evidence-based hospital design benefits. Being honest about whether we’re going to make any substantial impact is probably one of the hardest parts of design thinking.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/urology-room.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/urology-room-80x80.png" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a>On Wednesday, our first day of actual immersion, we went to Mile Square and did not find Dr. Niederberger, but fortunately, Dr. Kocjancic and his team took us under their wing. They sit in an open room with computers against opposite walls, then a hallway further down, then another identical room of people. They don’t know each other despite sitting so close. The team is Dr. Kocjancic, 2 residents (Niki and Ryan), and about 5 MAs (medical assistants; Marisol, Gaby, Mario, and others). Doctors get 3 rooms in the clinic and variable residents per attending. They had 37 scheduled patients, and the nurse handles walk-ins as feasible. It looked like Dr. K spent over an hour signing EHR messages. This entailed repeatedly copy-pasting “I saw the patient and confirm…” and hitting sign, patient after patient. They use Powerchart EHR. One resident says the “templates suck” and are clumsy when loading lab data and so prefers EPIC. Most of the team speaks Spanish and made several phone calls to patients in Spanish. In general, I notice everyone seems pretty happy and relaxed, at least compared to my hospital visits earlier at UIH in internal medicine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first patient I saw had a right kidney complaint. The MA took vitals, and if patient asks, resident then comes in to get a urine sample, but the patient didn’t ask for it, so she left. The next patient had a ureteral stent for kidney stones, but the flimsy string part hanging through the urethra came out. She had to go to the ER w/ a 103 fever. Niki says this can be common because the string is so flimsy. People often forget to call for a follow-up appointment after a few months to remove the stent. Gaby says it’s not usually an issue because if the patients forget, the team will catch it and contact them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Niki showed us an IPP, inflatable penile implant, and we noticed the pump part is very hard to press. Still, malleable implants, which stay the same size and just get bent as desired by the patient, are less frequent despite seeming easier to use in my opinion. Implants are used only after pharmaceuticals like Viagara and Cialis are tried. We learned sexual dysfunction is an ambiguous, hard to measure, quality of life issue, so a questionnaire is necessary to quantify satisfaction in some way to get insurance coverage. For whatever reason, a female questionnaire does not yet exist. We learned that psychological basis for dysfunction is uncommon, but when it exists, it’s much more prevalent in males than females.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When looking at MRIs/CTs, the team finds prostates hard to find because they need to look for darkness/shadowing. During a prostate exam I saw, Ryan couldn’t simultaneously hold the man’s penis while adjusting the flexible cystoscope, so the nurse had to help him. Another patient had pilonidal disease. Dr. K injects collagenase, which he said is very expensive, and asks the patient to physically contort the penis to make the calcification dissolve and break apart. The last patient was female and was probed to check if past surgery was successful. They usually keep the lights off to see the monitor for the cystoscope better, but this time had to turn all the lights on to get a better view of the urethra. The nurse says the tools for water in injection/release on the cystoscope and general communication with her team are great and she doesn’t run into any problems or have any complaints.</p>
