<p>The huge transition to college life triggers a lot of emotions for many students. Some may feel excited to start this new chapter of their lives, some may feel nervous, and others may be indifferent. I remember riding an emotional roller coaster before starting my undergraduate studies at UIC. I was glad that I (left behind many toxic people in high school) should this be changed to (got to leave high school behind)???, but I also felt very tense about the social, emotional, and academic challenges I would face at UIC. However, after my first semester, all of those tensions have gone away, and I am very content with where I am at in my undergraduate career. Here are four tips that have helped me the most with a smooth transition to college life.</p>
<p><b>Tip 1-Get out of your comfort zone. </b>By getting out of your comfort zone, you will achieve a new perspective on all aspects of life, since you will continuously discover and be exposed to new activities. Furthermore, you will acquire a huge boost in confidence once you accomplish something that you never thought you’d be able to accomplish.</p>
<p><b>Tip 2-Seek help when needed. </b>There will inevitably come a time where you will need help to overcome academic, social, and emotional challenges. Many freshmen feel that they are on their own 100% to deal with these problems. However, it is completely fine to ask for help, and no one should make you feel inferior for seeking help. If you feel yourself getting behind in calculus or struggling with academic writing, then go to office hours. Students often feel intimidated by professors, but they don’t realize that the sole reason for office hours is to seek help or voice any concerns. Moreover, if you are facing emotional or social challenges, there are many resources available at UIC to help you, like the Wellness Center and Counseling Center.</p>
<p><b>Tip 3-Get involved. </b>Since you will be leaving behind old high school friends, getting involved in extracurriculars will immensely help you build connections and strong friendships with other students. You will be able to discover your weaknesses and strengths and likes and dislikes. Additionally, extracurricular activities serve as a great resume-building tool and will tremendously help you land a good job after graduation or even during your undergraduate career.</p>
<p><b>Tip 4-Be good to yourself. </b>It’s so easy to get caught up in exams and other commitments that students often forget to take some time off to relax, and when we fail, we often punish ourselves for not being the best. Being good to yourself will help you accept failure and learn from previous mistakes. So go discover the city with your friends, and go watch a couple of episodes of your favorite TV series. Basically, do whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p>I wish you the very best with your transition to college!</p>

<p>My 21-year-old brother was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder when he was around two and a half years old. My parents noticed his impaired speech; he slowly stopped communicating and using words that a typical three-year-old would use. After his speech loss, he has been very dependent. He has been unable to function in daily life activities, like basic housekeeping, without a tremendous amount of aid from others. Currently, he is learning to communicate through iPad applications, and he is enrolled in a special education program that provides training in vocational skills.</p>
<p>My brother’s condition has influenced me in a lot of ways. I have gone through plenty of emotional burdens and many what-if scenarios in my head. It hurts me to see the occasional body language, from strangers and even some family members, that judges his atypical behavior. It frustrates me to see him cry or have a meltdown, since I feel so helpless. There are many nights when I just wonder &#8211; what if my friends backbite about him? What if no one would want to marry me because of him? What does his future hold for him? What would life be like if he wasn’t autistic, or if I didn’t have a brother at all?</p>
<p>Even though life with an autistic brother is challenging, he has taught me valuable life lessons. Watching my brother’s struggle with basic communication, I have learned always to be grateful and to never take life for granted. I am grateful to go to an amazing school in the city and to be able to interact with all my peers. I have also learned to have patience from his sporadic behavior. Instead of worrying about what others think, I concentrate on what I can do as a sister to make him feel better. Most importantly, I am learning to become a strong person. Without a doubt, my brother’s condition has created some hurdles for our family to overcome. However, we have been able to work through all of them by having strong and encouraging attitudes. Likewise, I am confident that by the time I graduate, I will be strong enough to overcome any curveballs thrown at me in my professional career.</p>

<p><strong>Five Tips: How To Survive Finals Week</strong><br />
<strong>By:  Polina Gubareva</strong></p>
<p>No matter what major or year in school you are, I know that you may feel the pressure of finals week creeping up on you. Even though everyone is different, we can all agree that two goals to have during this time would be success and a low stress level.</p>
<p>As a junior, I have gathered these five tips on how to accomplish these goals:</p>
<p>#1: Sleep</p>
<p>I know. Starting off with this is totally expected, but sleep is one of the most important things you can do for yourself during finals week. Some people may claim to be able to function on three or four hours of sleep, but most of us need our solid seven or eight hours. If you plan your sleep ahead of time, you may find that it will help you study better because your mind will be well-rested. So, even though you are giving time towards sleep, the time you use to study will be more efficient.</p>
<p>#2: Eat Healthy</p>
<p>Even though junk food is fast, easy, and gives you energy quickly, it is damaging to your health in the long run and is actually not helping your memory! Try to switch out junk food with alternatives like fruits, vegetables, or even smoothies. Keep in mind, you can still treat yourself to carbohydrates and sweets, but keep it in moderation.</p>
<p>#3: Use Your Resources</p>
<p>UIC and the Honors College have plenty of recourses designed to help students succeed and keep stress and anxiety to a minimum. Make full use of the Honors College student tutors. Go see your personal Honors College advisor, and explore places like the Science Learning Center, the Math Learning Center, and the Writing Center. In addition, visit the Wellness Center if you need to talk to someone about your stress or anxiety.</p>
<p>#4: Don’t Procrastinate</p>
<p>Even though the new seasons coming out on Netflix look tempting, make sure you get a head start on knowing what you need to study for each final, and take the time to manage your time evenly among all of your subjects. It may even help to make your own schedule, but make sure to include small study breaks, when you can eat a healthy snack, exercise, rest, or indulge in an episode or two of your favorite show.</p>
<p>#5: Be Selfish</p>
<p>It is easy to get caught up in helping others, or in socializing with friend groups that may have different course loads. I have friends that get upset with me during finals week because I tend to put my social life to the side and zone in on my work. I’m not saying to completely ignore everybody, but instead to be smart with your time. For example, instead of going out to dinner with your friends, take a rain check until finals are over, but still keep in touch with them during your study breaks.</p>
<p>All in all, in order to succeed during finals week, make sure that you stay positive and never stop pushing towards your goal. And remember, after that week is over, we get a whole month of winter break! Good luck and study hard!</p>
<p><strong>How to Get Through Finals<br />
</strong><strong>By: Dyese Moody</strong></p>
<p>There’s one thing that probably scares students more than having to worry about loans and financial aid. Finals. You say goodbye to your social life, your sleep, and your sanity for a week. As much as we might despise their existence, we can’t escape their wrath on our grade in a class, which then affects our overly sensitive GPAs. The best part of finals is not when you finally finish taking them, but when you get the grades back. Here are some tips that I have for getting through finals:</p>
<p>#1:  How to Study</p>
<p>Set up a reasonable schedule to study for each course. Don’t dedicate five hours to studying for a course you don’t have trouble with. For example, I’ll spend one hour on psychology each day and four hours on organic chemistry because I understand psychology much better than organic chemistry.</p>
<p>#2: Can I Take a Break?</p>
<p>Take short breaks in between your hours of studying; it won’t kill you or your grade to take a break. Don’t study for five hours straight! Take a five-15 minute break for each hour you study and/or when you switch the subject you are studying.</p>
<p>#3: Food</p>
<p>Don’t forget to eat. You actually need sustenance to function.</p>
<p>#4: Alone or in a Group?</p>
<p>Try to have a study group for classes that are difficult for you. It’s beneficial to have someone there to talk out problems or topics that you may not understand or vice-versa. Also, it’s great to see that you aren’t suffering alone.</p>
<p>#5: Sleep</p>
<p>At least try to get a solid eight hours of sleep before you take your exam. Taking an exam while you’re exhausted is the worst because it’s easier for you to lose focus, mix up information, or misinterpret questions.</p>
<p>#6: Me Time</p>
<p>Take 30 minutes to an hour to do something for yourself that doesn’t involve schoolwork.</p>
<p>#7: Motivation</p>
<p>Find a quote, video, song, or something to keep you calm before your exam, hype you up to take your exam, or convince you that you will be fine when you take the exam.</p>

<p>The American Student Dental Association (ASDA) is a widely known organization for dental and pre-dental students. Once a year, they hold a national leadership conference right here in Chicago, at the Hilton Hotel. I had an amazing experience attending this conference this year, and I hope to share a few things I took away from it.</p>
<p>The conference is separated into different topics ranging from pre-dental issues, leadership, career planning, personal development, and ASDA Chapter Management.</p>
<p>I chose to attend mostly pre-dental activities, which included workshops on how to write a personal statement, a mock interview process, a panel of admissions directors (including UIC College of Dentistry’s Director of Admissions, Carolyn Feller!), and even a workshop on how to expand and strengthen a Pre-Dental Club. In addition, I attended a few wellness lectures, one of which was led by our very own Johanna Strokoff, who is a psychologist at UIC. She taught us how to recognize and overcome the negative effects of stress. Also, I attended a program regarding women in dentistry. It was a panel of three very accomplished dentists who truly inspired me and only made my passion for dentistry stronger.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I was the <em>only</em> student from UIC representing the pre-dental population. How could this be? We are located only blocks away from this conference, while other students had to fly in from other states. Our accessibility to the city offers us many opportunities and resources, and I learned we should not take this for granted.</p>
<p>As an active member of the Pre-Dental Club here at UIC, I am hoping to organize a time for me to talk to my peers during a general meeting to teach them about what I learned, get more people involved with ASDA itself, and actually utilize the amazing opportunities it provides for us.</p>
<p>I also learned that these conferences are monumentally important no matter what career plan you may have. They allow you to learn from your peers and potential future dental school classmates. Also, it is not only important to attend these types of conferences but also to take the information back home and convey it to others.</p>
<p>With this comes the notion of leadership. One of my favorite quotes at the conference was as follows:</p>
<p>“Leadership is a skill that can be learned. It is a beneficial influence on others, and it’s a service,&#8221; said Dr. Gabe Holdwick.</p>
<p>Being a part of the Honors College instills this sort of passion in me to be a leader, to help those around me, and to positively influence my community. I felt that connection the entire time I was at the conference, and I represented UIC and the Honors College proudly.</p>
<p>If you are not a pre-dental student, I hope that reading about this motivates you to venture out of your comfort zone, join an organization that you have a passion for, and begin to network and immerse yourself into what you love as much as you can.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Running for Me, Running for Them</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HC15_2015.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-948" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HC15_2015.jpg" alt="HC15_2015" width="390" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>In August, I made a very big decision: to be healthy and active. After years of telling myself I would do so, I never really changed my habits. My family history of diabetes and high blood pressure was scary, yet I was going down the same path with my diet of pudding and cookies. But during the summer, I decided that enough was enough. I needed to change. The greatest struggle with this change was converting my internal desire to an actual behavior; my abstract idea of “health” needed a concrete goal. As a result, I challenged myself to run the Hot Chocolate 15K race in Chicago.</p>
<p>With my objective set, I started training every day. I spent time reading about running programs, muscle workout programs, calorie counting, and proper stretches to minimize injury. With my brother’s guidance, I created a workout plan and started running.</p>
<p>As school started and my academic workload increased, I prioritized my running and my eating schedule. Instead of ordering pizza or just snacking on cookies, I made sure that I ate something healthier (like salad or a peanut butter sandwich and yogurt). I reduced my procrastinating habits because I had to make time for running. I focused myself on my goal and knew that I would rather be running than wasting my time.</p>
<p>My decision to be healthy was not simply a change in eating habits. It was a change in my lifestyle and my priorities. I learned to be more disciplined with my time. For the first time in my life, I concentrated only on my needs and my time in order to be the most balanced person I could be. Throughout my life, I’ve found my identity in my friends and family; this time, I sought my identity from myself as a student and runner.</p>
<p>As race day approached in November, I continued to train, working on my physical and mental endurance. Running 15K (9.3 miles) was not going to be easy—my knees and feet would probably hurt and I may become discouraged running for over an hour with the finish line still another half hour away. But as it turned out, these thoughts didn’t come to mind during the race. I was buzzing with energy on race day, but I still paced myself throughout the race, never running too fast to lose my breath. My goal was to keep running and never stop to walk,, even when I was going uphill or felt tired.</p>
<p>And I did it! I ran the entire race at a steady pace of 10:50 min/mile, completing the race in 1 hour and 40 minutes!</p>
<p>Now, even with the run completed, I plan to continue making healthy choices and being active, even if it’s something as simple as taking the stairs and eating a banana over a Snickers bar. It’s the small things that really add up. However, it would be wrong to say that my training and discipline was the sole reason of my success. The training definitely gave me the confidence to run the race, but without the support of my family and my friends, I would have easily given up. Some of my friends drove a long distance to support me, holding posters and cheering me on while I ran; other friends were volunteering and cheered me on, motivating me to keep going. This was a constant reminder to never stop running—I wanted to make myself proud, and I wanted them to them to be proud of me.</p>
<p>While I started this race for myself and for my health, I finished this race because of the friendship and support I have in my life. It is this love and encouragement that drives me each day to keep working hard.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Volunteering: (Not) Going for the Glory</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/imd-guest-house-baking.jpg"><img class="wp-image-945 aligncenter" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/imd-guest-house-baking.jpg" alt="imd guest house baking" width="350" height="339" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of things we try to cram into four short years of undergraduate life: research, student organizations, social experiences, and more. It’s hard sometimes to balance a heavy load of coursework along with all the extra commitments that college students often take on. But at the same time, I feel like many college students—stressed as they might be—miss out on one of the most important and rewarding extracurriculars: volunteering.</p>
<p>It can be intimidating to search for interesting volunteer opportunities in the city; after all, Chicago is a big place, and there are countless options available. But what seems daunting is actually a blessing in disguise. With so many opportunities, there’s bound to be an activity or interest for everybody. Often times, there are a number of volunteering opportunities offered by student organizations, and it’s easy to get involved in something that excites you, such as volunteering to hand out water at a marathon or to walk dogs at a local shelter. In the past semester, I’ve gone with friends to package food at Feed my Starving Children in Schaumburg, helped to cheer on walkers at Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes alongside the UIC Association of Pre-Medical Students, and volunteered with the Vietnamese Student Association at the Hot Chocolate Run, among others. No two volunteer events have been the same, but each feels equally as worthwhile and rewarding.</p>
<p>While on-campus activities, such as research or joining clubs are integral parts of the overall UIC experience too, there’s something about the feeling of personally impacting other people through individual interactions at volunteer events.   Looking for a chance to do this? Think about going over to the Illinois Medical District Guest House and baking muffins for the families of patients seeking treatment there. The last time I did, I talked to several different people and learned their stories; most of them have travelled from out of state to seek treatment in Chicago, and one man told me that living at the IMD Guest House helped him feel like he wasn’t on his own in this big city. Or maybe consider helping out with pet therapy at the Lakeview Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre—you don’t even need to have a pet to volunteer! Volunteering is not only fun and a good way to get out and explore Chicago, but it’s also a great feeling to meet new people and realize that you can make their day a little bit better.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Tips for College: Staying Productive and Happy</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Adil-Blog-1-pic.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-941 aligncenter" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Adil-Blog-1-pic.jpg" alt="Adil Blog 1 pic" width="442" height="442" /></a></p>
<p>College is a place where we have the ability to reevaluate and build upon ourselves both academically and personally. College is truly a land of opportunity, which should be taken as a privilege by students.</p>
<p>College has been an enlightening experience for me, and here is some of what I’ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t change what you like:</li>
</ol>
<p>It is generally known that many students tend to select high-paying or “safe” careers, as they don’t want to risk their futures. However, from what I have seen around me, my friends who have followed their passions tend to be much happier than those who are pressured into certain paths.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Participate, and get involved around campus:</li>
</ol>
<p>College can offer several opportunities for you to explore. Maybe you like art? Or have a passion for public speaking? Organizations and other extracurricular activities can offer you opportunities to learn more about specific interests and maybe discover something new about yourself &#8212; and this is not a bad thing. Some tend to believe that participating in activities unrelated to their major and profession goals can hurt them, but this is absolutely incorrect. Involvement in a diverse set of activities, whether educational or social, can always be beneficial, as knowledge comes in many shapes and forms. It is our duty as students to explore those “if’s” and “what’s” in order to gain a more enriching, holistic perspective.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Manage your academic life with your social life :</li>
</ol>
<p>College can definitely get stressful and lead to us not having time to socialize. Don’t do this. The best way to manage the workload and the social sphere of your everyday life is to procrastinate less and do your work on time. This will allow you the liberty of making friends without having to sacrifice your academic excellence. And believe me when I say this: friends are a crucial part of your life; they are the ones who will be there when you’re panicking after an organic chemistry exam or when you need any sort of moral and emotional support. They will help you grow as a student and develop into the human being you aspire to become, all while also making memorable moments along the way.</p>
<p>These are my tips for surviving college and enjoying it. Always remember college is a privilege, so don’t take it for granted. Use it to better yourself and the community around you.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>From Rural to Urban: How to Adjust to Life in the City</b></h1>
<p><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSCN2320.jpg"><img class="wp-image-936 aligncenter" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSCN2320.jpg" alt="DSCN2320" width="612" height="344" /></a></p>
<p><em>            What animals do you raise?</em></p>
<p><em>            Have you ever driven a tractor?</em></p>
<p><em>            Do you like country music?</em></p>
<p><em>            What do you do for fun in a rural area?</em></p>
<p><em>            Where is Carthage, Illinois anyway?</em></p>
<p>As a UIC student raised in rural Illinois, I often receive questions similar to the previous list. Many of my fellow classmates are unaware of what it is like to live in a rural community and the culture it entails. Similarly, when I first came to Chicago two years ago as a freshman, I had no idea how different living in the city would be. I knew that there would be tall skyscrapers, heavy traffic, and sights to see. However, I was unaware of the blend of cultures, driven leaders, and amazing opportunities that the city had to offer. Although I have only lived in Chicago for two years, I feel like I have done a great job of establishing a life here and can confidently say that I made the right choice by selecting UIC for my undergraduate education.</p>
<p>While I am more than settled into the Chicagoan lifestyle, there are still times when I feel nostalgia for my previous life. Sometimes I crave the golden fields of harvest, the scent of a gentle breeze coming off the wild grasses, and the serenity of a walk through the woods. There are days when I miss the culture that I spent 18 years of my life partaking in. And like anyone, there are days when the longing for my family and childhood friends is difficult to bear. This feeling of nostalgia is commonly felt among college students, but can be especially difficult for those students who live farther away from their homes and are experiencing living in the city for the first time. At times it may even seem like there is no one else who understands this specific kind of homesickness.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are many places to go, people to talk to, and things you can do if you ever find yourself feeling this way. As an Honors College student, you can always feel free to speak with your Honors College Advisor or even your Honors College Ambassador about your concerns and what you can do to overcome them. Additionally, there are many other places to go on campus if you need help, such as the Counseling Center or to campus housing staff if you live in the dorms.</p>
<p>As a student who has battled the challenges of adjusting to the fast-paced culture of the city, I want to give a few bits of advice to those who may be currently going through the same struggle. This advice stems from my own personal experience as a rural student adapting to life in Chicago and at UIC.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accept and embrace the changes that come with moving to a large city.</strong> You will experience new cultures, beliefs, and ideas that are different than what you were used to in your rural community. Keep your mind open and take in as much as you can! (As Dorothy put it, “Toto, I’ve a feeling we are not in Kansas anymore.”)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Do well in your classes.</strong> Remember one of the main reasons that you are at UIC is to get an education. You will feel better about yourself and more connected to the university when you are accomplishing the educational goals you have set for yourself.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Join organizations you feel passionate about. </strong>The more involved you are with organizations, the more you will feel tied to the university. It doesn’t matter what kind (volunteer, cultural, academic, sport, or leisure) you pick, as joining any organization will motivate you towards reaching new goals. Additionally, if you find an organization that represents your interests, you will be more likely to find people with similar views as yourself and make more connections.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Find people with common interests. </strong>It is important to find people who you can relate to and feel comfortable around. These are also the people who will go on adventures with you and cheer you up when you are having a rough day. I would never had made it in the city without the incredible friends I made during my first two years!</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Explore the city as much as possible. </strong>There are so many places to go, sites to see, and food to eat. Some of my favorite memories stem from venturing into the city with friends. A few things I would encourage are: eating a gyro in Greektown, sunbathing at Oak Street Beach, riding the slides at Maggie Daley Park (even if you’re over the age limit), attending Festa Italiana, ice skating in Millennium Park, and visiting the many museums on free admission days. I would also encourage you to check out the Chicago Signature Honors Programming for other exciting events to experience! (https://chicagosignature.honors.uic.edu/ ) There is so much to do, but you must actively pursue it!</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Don’t go home too often.</strong> It is difficult to develop a new life at your college when you continually return to and stay attached to your old life. It is important to stay at school when you have free time to develop new relationships and build memories. This can be especially difficult at first, but it does get easier with time.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Realize that you can go home if you need to. </strong>Although I recommended not going home frequently, it is important to remember that if you get in a slump and become homesick, you can always arrange a trip home. Don’t bottle up your homesickness until it is unbearable. Sometimes, time at home is just what we need to rejuvenate. (I personally go home about once a month.)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Use Skype/Facetime to stay in touch with family and friends. </strong>With today’s technology, it is easier than ever to stay in contact with people over long distances. Use these tools to call your family and friends and share with them all of your amazing adventures at UIC.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Be proud of your heritage and share your own background knowledge and experiences with others</strong>. It is important that you take in and learn from others about life in the city. However, it is also important to share your own experiences and culture that you have from living in a rural community. It can be beneficial to show others who you are and what matters to you. It is this exchange of ideas from the diverse groups we have that make UIC such an amazing institution! Realize that you are important and have valuable information to contribute!</li>
</ol>
<p>As a rural student at UIC, you have the amazing opportunity to experience both the rural and urban ways of life. You have the ability to be a rural diplomat when in the city, and an urban diplomat when you return home. It can be difficult to adjust to the changes, but if you are able to stick with it, it can have an amazing impact on your life. I can assuredly say that it has changed me for the better.</p>
<p><em>Answers to opening questions:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Cows</em></li>
<li><i>Yes</i></li>
<li><em>Of course ( &lt;3 Carrie Underwood)</em></li>
<li><em>Gardening, bonfires, mushroom hunting, trapshooting</em></li>
<li><em>Western Illinois near Iowa and Missouri border</em></li>
</ol>

		<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Navratri: The Most Wonderful Time of the Year!</b></h1>
<p><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garba2015NK.jpg"><img class="wp-image-927 aligncenter" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garba2015NK.jpg" alt="Garba2015NK" width="294" height="523" /></a></p>
<p>Bells tinkling, skirts swaying, bangles jangling, earrings twinkling…Navratri is my favorite time of the year!</p>
<p>Navratri, an important Hindu holiday, is celebrated for nine days every year beginning sometime in October. This year, Navratri was celebrated from October 13-21. Literally translating to “nine nights,” this holiday honors nine goddesses of the Hindu faith—one on each night of the celebration. These goddesses symbolize female strength, faith, and discipline. We pray to them as they deliver courage and hope to overcome obstacles. While my largest obstacles during this time are my impending midterms and papers, the goddesses give me strength—perhaps in the form of coffee! —to stay up late to study.</p>
<p>To celebrate Navratri, an altar is placed on the center of the floor and decorated with a goddess. Around this altar, men, women, and children dressed in traditional clothing perform a traditional folk dance, <em>garba. </em>At one side, musicians sing folk music and play their various instruments. Dancers form concentric circles around the altar, with each circle following a different variation of garba. The older generation may perform a simpler, three-step garba, while the younger generations dance more intricate, fast-paced steps. In any case, this dance can be done in any form and at any speed.</p>
<p>When I dance, I lose myself in the music, in the atmosphere, and in my worship. This holiday gives me an opportunity to celebrate my heritage and my devotion. Though I’ve grown up in the United States, I eagerly anticipate this holiday each year, putting on my anklets and picking out my dresses and jewelry well in advance. I even give up my procrastinating habits, getting my work done early so that I can go dance on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>My mom tells me that since I could walk, I’ve been dancing garba. In India, Navratri is only celebrated for nine days; but in the United States, garbas are held on most weekends throughout October and even into early November. My weekends have been booked for the next month!</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Get Up and Grab a Hat!</b></h1>
<p><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pillaiphoto1-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-904 aligncenter" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pillaiphoto1-2.jpg" alt="pillaiphoto1 (2)" width="588" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s easy to let yourself get pigeonholed in college.</p>
<p>People often preach the importance of finding research or getting an internship. They tell students that they need to join clubs and make connections, work towards furthering themselves in their career fields and most importantly, <em>stay focused.</em></p>
<p>I took that information to heart as a freshman in the Honors College, and tried to do all the things that older students had told me were important as a pre-med student: I found a position as a research assistant, joined the Society of Future Physicians, and was even looking into volunteering at a city hospital. And I don’t regret any of it, because I’ve made friends and had wonderful opportunities to explore my future career field alongside other students who are working towards goals similar to mine.</p>
<p>But then I decided that I needed to slow down and take a moment to do something different.</p>
<p>It started when my friend dragged me to a Vietnamese Student Association meeting—and it ended with me performing traditional hat dance as a member of their cultural dance team.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that I didn’t drop everything that I had already established. I still went to physician lectures at SFP, I still conducted research on the correlation between capillary blood flow in the eyes and heart disease, and I still enjoyed it all. My career-focused activities were a huge part of my school year, and I’m glad for all the invaluable experiences they’ve provided me, but I’m also glad that I didn’t spend all year trying to think of ways to prepare myself for graduate school.</p>
<p>Cultural dance was not only an escape from the more academic-oriented portions of my life, but it was also a way for me to experience a totally different culture, meet people I would have never met if I stuck only to pre-med associations. Most importantly, it was an experience I never thought I’d have in college.</p>
<p>I never would have imagined that I could be standing center-stage in the Forum, wearing a long, traditional áo dai and carrying a wide bamboo hat. I never could have seen myself performing in different venues all around the city at traditional Vietnamese New Year celebrations. I never anticipated having such a good time at VSA (I’m not even Vietnamese, for the record), and I’m so glad I was wrong.</p>
<p>As students, we need to work hard; that’s a given. We need to work to further our interests and meet our goals, to gain experience now that’ll be valuable in our careers later—but we also need to have fun. People will tell you how to beef up your resume and get the most out of your courses, but not enough people will tell you to go out and try something new.</p>
<p>And what better time to do it than now?</p>
