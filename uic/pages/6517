Class time was spent making some very rough prototypes (evidence shown above as a pipe cleaner body analog). With presentations coming up soon, the week int he clinic was spent inquiring with the staff about our proposed device and adjusting from their feedback. Additionally, I spent a great deal of time doing my own secondary research, outside of the clinic, then parsing the differences between staff anecdotes and the literature. </p>
<p>I was a bit sentimental this last week, the hospital has come to feel like home. Its people and their pace are enthralling, and I will miss the days spent listening to their stories and learning through their demonstrations and lectures. Upon the conclusion of this program, I will look for ways of staying involved with the medical campus. Not only do I think it will be beneficial for my professional development, but I have come to really enjoy medicine and the people who practice it.</p>

The development of pressure sores is a common issue in the NSICU, which often leads to infections and severe patient discomfort. According to the staff at the hospital, the current solutions to this problem include periodic rotation of the patient, special air mattresses to rotate pressure points, and disposable bedding pads.</p>
<p>During class this week, we settled on a needs statement. We also learned and practiced several methods for brainstorming ideas and sifting through them (including rapid sketching of ideas, as shown in the image above). Following this exercise, our team decided to pursue several possible solutions. I kept them in mind as we continued our time in the clinic. As well as our need statement: &#8220;Prevent the development of pressure sores on unconscious patients&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was difficult identifying more criteria for narrowing down to a single solution, and I will be using my remaining time in the clinic to use primary research to narrow down to our team&#8217;s solution.</p>

I chose to focus on an issue that affects the staff rounding in the ICU. They use PCs built into push carts,  called EMR carts or PC carts, during their rounds to pull up patient records and put in orders for patient treatments. These carts are bulky, dirty, and expensive. My initial statement began as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reduce hallway congestion by reducing the size of the PC carts.&#8221;</p>
<p>After interviewing several members of the staff about how they feel about the carts, I was surprised to hear that a lot of them actually liked the larger size of the carts. The increased size gives plenty of space for a table top area for writing, and it also allows for a larger viewing screen and a full keyboard. All of these things would be difficult to accommodate on a smaller model, but not impossible. I revised the statement to:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maintaining the current functionality of the PC carts, reduce the the size of aesthetic or non-major components of the cart to allow for improved flow of staff through the ICU hallway.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ignored what the staff likes about the carts for a moment, and considered the issue of staff flow through the hallway. On several occasions, in a single morning, staff members detoured around our rounding team to get to their patients or other destinations. This is a big issue in a department that can see rapid patient decline in minutes or even an instant. So the focus then becomes preserving the current characteristics of the carts that the staff likes, while still reducing their hallway footprint.</p>
<p>As an aside, the carts wheels are designed with deep, narrow slits that seem to trap grime from the floor. There seems no easy way to clean them, and with a price point of ~$6,000 this should not be a concern for a device designed for a hospital. However, this design feature may be out of the scope of this need statement. I am thinking of pursuing a redesign of these carts, and now see that several need statements will be needed to do so.</p>

I decided this would make an excellent procedure to storyboard for this weeks exercise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Things begin when the patient is wheeled into the room, on their bed, from the prep room. One nurse consoled the nervous patient as the other began laying out drapes and preparing the instrumentation. The patient was then asked a series of questions, for identity confirmation, before being anaesthetized and intubated. Because of the area of operation, the patients head was shaved following intubation, and the scalp was then cleaned with several times with a soapy mixture, alcohol, and iodine. The patients head was then rested on what the staff called a &#8220;horse shoe&#8221;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This device created a 5-10 minute delay in the procedure. It is difficult to assemble and falls apart often. It is a couple of pads attached to a metal frame, which supports the patient&#8217;s head during surgery. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HorseShoe.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HorseShoe-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Horse Shoe&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HorseShoe-Bottom.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HorseShoe-Bottom-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perspective from bottom</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HorseShoe-Wrapped.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HorseShoe-Wrapped-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ultimately, the staff resorted to wrapping the fixture in gauze to hold the pads on, which is something they said they do often.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cleaning ended with an Iodine laced sticker being placed across the entire scalp. The mid-line and incision line were marked with a pen and covering sheets were stapled in place around the area of operation. I overheard the staff discussing the occasional patient getting unwanted ear or nipple piercings. An unintended consequence of using surgical staples to hold the sheets in place against the patient. Curiously, the second layer of sheets, and scum bag, were held in place by an adhesive strip on the bottom side of the material, then stapled as well. I wonder if one style of fixation would be enough. The patient’s ID and needed operation was then confirmed a second time by one the surgeons, as a nurse read the patient’s name and operation aloud. The surgeon then proceeded to operate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the operation I noticed chances for improvement. The staff didn’t have enough saline to fully submerse the bone flap being replaced and needed to get more from a neighboring OR. Additionally, one of the patient’s IV drips had completely ran out before the attending anesthesiologist had noticed, and blood splattered the sheets and floor where the scumbag had failed to catch escaping fluid. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The operation finished without medical complication. Following completion of the operation, the patient was removed from anesthesia and gently woke up. The patient was then lifted by the surgical staff from the operating table to a new bed that wheeled her into the recovery room. </p>

My first day began with rounds in the NSICU with Dr. Arshi. His deeply rooted passion for innovation and education became obvious after a short time, and I felt lucky to have landed with such a perfect teacher and guide for my first day. As my eyes and ears began to focus through the passing nurses, residents, and their jargon, I gathered details about my surroundings. The ICU is a rather uninviting place. The chimes and blips of instruments cut from every room and fill the hallways with the torrent of their noises to create an alarm that seemed to always be going off. Most patients were in varying levels of comatose and required devices to assist them in breathing and/or secretion control. Their condition and surrounding tangles of instrumentation created an atmosphere of desperation, and I feel that this likely causes patients and their visiting family anxiety.</p>
<p>After finishing rounding with Dr. Arshi, I left to meet my program mentor, Dr. Mehta, outside the operating room. While I was waiting, I studied the surrounding staff and tried to understand their rhythm. People passed quickly, ducking in and out of rooms, delivering supplies or lending aid. Carts of surgical kits were stacked along most walls of the extra wide hallways, but their seemed to always be staff carrying tools into started procedures. I assume this means the surgeon needing more than expected is not all that uncommon. In general, the OR felt more systematic than the ICU. The planned, methodical atmosphere matched the type of work being done, as much as the unpredictable atmosphere of the ICU matched its own. Dr. Mehta arrived, and we stepped into his OR. The staff outside the sterile field talked casually, while those inside prepared their tools and themselves silently. This divide in demeanor continued through the operation. Towards the later part of the operation, Dr. Mehta used a surgical microscope as he worked, and its partnered screen allowed for myself and three other students to comfortably view the surgery, as if we were leaning over his shoulder.</p>
<p>I was back in the ICU with Dr. Arshi the next morning. I had asked about the mechanism of the assisted breathing devices most of the patients seemed to have. After explaining it, he added that most of the patients are actually capable of breathing on their own, but they have been intubated or have undergone a tracheostomy because they are unable to keep their saliva from going down their trachea. This was as depressing as it was shocking, and I felt a new type of empathy for the patients who suffered through the risks and discomforts of these treatments.</p>
<p>My week ended with Dr. Mehta and one of his students, Dr. Theiss, in the outpatient clinic. Most of my personal experiences in the hospital have taken place in this area, and it felt familiar. The calm, scented air seemed strange after my time in the ICU and OR. The pace of things was still fast, but lower stakes were definitely reflected in the mood of the staff. Things were mostly relaxed, but tensions seemed to always rise when patients talked about their health insurance provider. Patients had missed treatment because they were dropped from their insurance, and others worried what treatments they could afford under their current plan.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my week, I tried to imagine myself as a patient and then medical student. As a teaching hospital, UIC has an obligation to the needs of both. As a patient, I would be horrified to have to choose between the options of tracheal intubation or a traechostomy. Invasive surgery weighted against the discomfort and dangers of intubation would not be an easy choice. Both procedures offer a serious risk of infection, and intubation leads to days or weeks of constant discomfort and/or sedation. Both of these procedures and devices presented the most impactful opportunity for innovation I found this week, and pertained to the needs of the patient. Whereas the use of the surgical microscope as an instrument for both surgery and education was the most innovative solution I found, and it greatly improved the educational experience for students in the OR.</p>

I am a bioengineering student, with passions for improving patients&#8217; hospital experience, and improve quality of life during recovery and post recovery. I was fortunate to be placed in my preferred department of neurosurgery. I will use my time there to learn more about the technology surrounding the treatment of the nervous system and the interactions patients have with this technology. I will apply my new experiences with these devices and patients to further my work with prosthetic and assistive devices, as well as aide in developing my understanding of brain computer interfaces.</p>
