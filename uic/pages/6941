    <p class="clsSubHead"><a name="a" id="a"></a>Introduction </p>
    <p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  (LAS) offers a wide range of programs and courses in the humanities, social  sciences, and natural sciences. The offerings of LAS contribute to the  educational quality, breadth, and vitality of UIC. The tradition of the liberal  arts emphasizes holistic intellectual development rather than vocational and  professional training. An understanding of human cultures, the natural universe,  and social sciences provides the foundation for comprehending the complex and  evolving world in which we live.</p>
    <p>LAS undergraduate degree programs encompass a  broad-based general education experience, a student-selected field of  specialization, and elective courses to round out a student&rsquo;s interests. Students  are encouraged to participate in faculty-led research and scholarly  opportunities, as well as internships and study abroad. Graduates are prepared to pursue nearly any career path and further education. </p>
<p class="clsSubHead"> <a name="b" id="b"></a>Degree Requirements </p>
    <p>To earn a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  degree from UIC, students need to complete University, college, and  department degree requirements. </p>
    <p>Changes to graduation  requirements and related policies are announced online. If requirements  are changed, continuing students in LAS and those whose attendance at  UIC has been interrupted for no more than two years may complete the  current graduation requirements or may continue to meet those  requirements in effect at the time of initial registration in the college. Students  who return to UIC after an absence of more than two years are  responsible for meeting the requirements of the University and college  as well as of the major or curriculum in effect at the time of the  student&rsquo;s reenrollment. For all students, however, if courses  originally required are no longer offered or if external accrediting or  certifying agencies modify their requirements, the college or  department will specify substitutes.</p>
    <p>University  and college degree requirements for all College of Liberal Arts and  Sciences students are outlined below. Students should consult their  department section for additional degree requirements.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"> <a name="c" id="c"></a>Semester Hour Requirement</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Each of the degree programs listed below minimally requires a total of 120 semester hours.</p>

      <span class="clsSubHead3">General Education Core</span><br />
    General Education at UIC is designed to  serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. The following General  Education Core requirements for the College of Liberal Arts and  Sciences satisfy the University&rsquo;s minimum requirements. Students in the  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences are required to take a total of nine courses. Of those, seven are prescribed: two laboratory courses in  Analyzing the Natural World and one course in each of the other five   categories. The remaining two courses may be chosen freely from among  any of the six categories. </p>
<p>Students who  register for a course that is listed in more than one category will  have the flexibility of deciding which category the course will satisfy.  They do not have to decide right away but may wait to see how their  plan of study develops over time. The course, however, will fulfill the  requirement of only one category. In other words, the course will not  satisfy the requirement of two categories just because it is listed in  two categories.</p>
    <p>The General Education Core categories are as follows:</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Analyzing the Natural World</li>
      <li>Understanding the Individual and Society</li>
      <li>Understanding the Past</li>
      <li>Understanding the Creative Arts</li>
      <li>Exploring World Cultures</li>
      <li>Understanding U.S. Society</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For a description and list of courses for each General Education Core category, students should consult the <em>General Education</em> section of the catalog. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Up to two courses in the major may count toward fulfillment of General  Education Core requirements. Students should see their department  sections to determine if their major includes any approved General  Education Core courses. </p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3">General Education Proficiencies&mdash;Foreign Language Requirement, Quantitative Reasoning Requirement, and University Writing Requirement</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Foreign Language Requirement</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The basic requirement is proficiency in a  language that has a recognized literature or culture. The level of  proficiency must be the equivalent of that expected of the student who  has completed the elementary and intermediate levels of language study  (i.e., the first two years) at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  Students studying foreign language at UIC are strongly  encouraged to register for required language courses in consecutive  semesters until the requirement is met. Students may satisfy the  requirement in any one of several ways:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>By  presenting qualifying scores on Advanced Placement examinations in  foreign language or a qualifying score on a UIC foreign language  placement test or other authorized proficiency test for languages not  offered at UIC. </li>
      <li>By transferring  credit for two years of a single language at the college level. With  college approval, a student transferring from another university or  another UIC college who has never been enrolled in LAS, who is admitted  with senior standing and who has not satisfied the language requirement  may do so by passing one course in a language sequence during each term  in enrollment residence at UIC. Seniors admitted with foreign language  transfer credit must consult a dean for application of this rule. </li>
      <li>By  completing four semesters of language courses at UIC. The college  currently offers complete sequences in  Arabic, Chinese, French, German,  Modern Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Lithuanian, Polish,  Russian, and Spanish. </li>
      <li>By  completing a partial sequence of language courses as determined by the  results of a placement test or placement by a language department. The  college determines eligibility for credit in a recommended course. </li>
      <li>By  presenting evidence of secondary education completed in a country where  the language of instruction was other than English. No elementary- or  intermediate-level course or proficiency credit will be given for that  language. The language requirement, however, will be considered  fulfilled only if the student consults a dean for application of this  rule and receives conditional approval.</li>
      <li>By  transferring four semesters of credit in American Sign Language courses  from an accredited U.S. college or university. Courses must include the  study of deaf culture.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Quantitative Reasoning Requirement</strong><span class="clsSubHead3"><br />
    </span>Students in the College of Liberal Arts and  Sciences must demonstrate competency in quantitative reasoning to earn  a degree. Such competence can be demonstrated in any one of the  following ways: </p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Achievement  of a score on the mathematics placement examination high enough to  qualify for enrollment in Mathematics 180. Placement in Mathematics 180  may be by other means determined by the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. </li>
      <li>Grade of C or better in any one of the following courses: Mathematics 121, 123, 145,  160, 165, 180, Statistics 101. </li>
      <li>Grade  of C or better in a mathematically oriented course in a department in  LAS other than Mathematics. Such courses must require Mathematics 090  or 118 as a prerequisite. At present, such courses include  Communication 201; Criminology, Law, and Justice 262; Political Science  201; Psychology 343; and Sociology 201. </li>
      <li>Grade of C or better in a logic course in the Department of Philosophy: Philosophy 102 or 210. </li>
      <li>Transfer  students may present equivalent courses taken elsewhere, for which they  have received a grade of C or better, to satisfy this requirement. </li>
    </ol>
       
    <p><strong>University Writing Requirement</strong><span class="clsSubHead3"><br />
      </span>Each student must demonstrate proficiency in  written expression by the successful completion of English 160 and 161.  The student&rsquo;s performance on the writing placement test determines  whether English 050, 060, 070, or 071 must be completed as a  prerequisite to English 160. Students may receive 3 hours of  proficiency credit in English 160 based on the ACT English subscore.  All 
    students must complete English 161.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">No  graduation credit is given for ENGL 070 or 071, which are preparatory  courses for UIC&rsquo;s required academic writing sequence. Upon completion  of either of these courses, however, the English Department may  recommend a waiver of ENGL 160 based on final course assessment.  Students who receive this waiver earn 3 hours of proficiency credit for  ENGL 160 and placement into ENGL 161.<br />
  <br />
  </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Writing-in-the-Discipline Requirement</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">As part of the major, students must  successfully complete at least one course that requires extensive  writing. This course should be taken before the beginning of the  student&rsquo;s last semester. A required Writing-in-the-Discipline course is  included in each degree program.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="e" id="e"></a>Other Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3"><br />
  Course Level Requirement<br />
</span>A student must earn a minimum of 40 semester  hours in advanced-level courses (those numbered 200 and above at UIC)   at any accredited four-year college or university. At least 12 semester  hours of these 40 advanced hours must be taken in the major field while  in enrollment residence at UIC. Community college work, regardless of  the course number or level, is not considered advanced for the purposes  of this requirement.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Course Work Limitations </span><br />
    Course work completed at UIC and other  accredited institutions is not automatically applicable toward  graduation requirements. The final decision regarding the acceptance of  credit and courses that apply toward degree requirements is made by the  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Course work considered by the  college office as nonbaccalaureate or remedial is not accepted toward  the degree. Course work that duplicates previous work is counted toward  graduation, whereas the original course work does not count. No credit  is given for a course in which a failing grade was received. Credit for  prerequisite courses will not be granted if prerequisite courses are taken after advanced course work  in the same area.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences restricts degree credit as follows:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>No  more than 3 semester hours of credit in basic kinesiology activity or designated military science courses may apply toward the degree. Basic activity courses at UIC  include all kinesiology courses numbered 100&ndash;149 and all courses  numbered 200&ndash;248. Acceptable military science courses are those numbered 101&ndash;121.</li>
      <li> A maximum  of 6 semester hours of credit in advanced military science courses  (those numbered at the 200- and 300-levels at UIC) may apply toward the  degree.</li>
      <li>Credit in individual performance courses is limited to 8 semester hours.</li>
      <li>No  credit is given for doctrinal and canonical course work taken in  seminaries or any other institution that provides religious or  sectarian training.</li>
      <li>No more than  16 semester hours of independent study may apply toward the degree. The  maximum degree credit in independent study in an individual department  or program is 8 semester hours. Fieldwork and internship courses that  are formally required for the major are excluded from this limitation. </li>
      <li>A  maximum of 24 semester hours in courses offered by other UIC colleges  and acceptable by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences may be  applicable toward the degree. Transfer courses from other liberal arts colleges must be equivalent to those offered by other UIC colleges to be acceptable. In cases where  majors, minors, and curricula require courses not offered in the  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the student may take no more than  24 hours of non-LAS courses in addition to those non-LAS courses  required for the program.                  </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Elective Credit</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Together, the major and LAS course requirements generally do not provide the entire 120 semester hours  required for graduation. Known as electives, those hours remaining  should serve to enrich a student&rsquo;s educational background either  through work allied to the major or in courses that can generally  increase knowledge and understanding. Elective courses should always be  chosen by a student for educational reasons, not simply for convenience  or for credit hours.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A student must earn a cumulative grade point  average of at least 2.00/4.00 in all work taken at UIC. In addition,  the combined average of a student&rsquo;s transfer work and work taken at UIC  must be at least 2.00. A minimum grade point average of 2.00 is  required for all courses in the major field. In addition, the combined  average of transfer work and work taken at UIC in all courses in the  major field must be at least 2.00. Some majors may require a higher  grade point average. Failure to maintain the required minimum grade  point average in the major may result in the student's dismissal from that major. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students declare their intent to graduate  online using<em> my.UIC</em>. Students who do not have access to <em>my.UIC</em> should contact the LAS Student Academic Affairs  Office to file the Intent to Graduate form. The deadline for submission  to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and  spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which  graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may  delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following  the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all  the degree requirements, the student&rsquo;s name will be placed on the  official degree list.</p>
    <p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences reserves the right to recommend the awarding of a degree once degree requirements have been fulfilled without prior request or approval of the student.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Enrollment Residence Requirement</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">For the major, a student must complete at  least one-half of the course work required for the major, excluding  collateral course requirements, in enrollment residence at the  University of Illinois at Chicago. The major course work completed in  enrollment residence must include at least 12 semester hours at the  advanced level. </p>
<p>For all course work,  either the first 90 semester hours or the last 30 semester hours of  degree work must be completed in continuous, uninterrupted enrollment  residence at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Concurrent  attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another  collegiate institution, or enrollment during the summer at another  institution, when approved by the student&rsquo;s college, does not interrupt  the UIC enrollment residence requirement.</p>
    <p>Work  taken at the Springfield and Urbana-Champaign campuses of the  University of Illinois does not satisfy these requirements. Credit  earned through proficiency examinations including the College Level  Examination Program (CLEP), UIC extension courses, and Urbana-Champaign  distance-learning courses does not apply toward the minimum  30-semester-hour enrollment residence requirement. Study abroad and  distance-learning courses that have been approved by the student&rsquo;s  major department and by the college are not considered an interruption  of enrollment residence for students in the College of Liberal Arts and  Sciences.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Credit </span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Course work completed at other colleges and  universities may apply toward partial fulfillment of graduation  requirements and may be used as prerequisites for courses at UIC. The  University of Illinois at Chicago is a participant in the Illinois  Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide agreement that allows for  the transfer of the IAI-approved General Education Core Curriculum  between participating institutions. Please consult <em>Illinois  Articulation Initiative</em> in the <em>Admissions</em> section of the catalog. The  final decision, however, regarding the acceptance of credit and courses  that apply toward degree requirements is made by the College of Liberal  Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Students who transfer  course work may anticipate some loss of credit. This might require more  time to complete the degree than had been originally planned. When the  loss of credit occurs, it does not imply a negative evaluation of a  student&rsquo;s transfer work but rather a lack of appropriateness for the  programs of the college. After admission to the University, students  must consult an advisor in the LAS Academic Advising Center.</p>
      
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Credit for Continuing Students </span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Continuing students who want to take course  work for credit at another institution, either concurrent with UIC  enrollment or during the summer term, must obtain prior written  approval from the college and, where appropriate, the relevant  department. Students will have to provide 
    justification for the request.</p>
<p>If  prior approval is not obtained from the college, credit will not be  allowed, and the Office of the Registrar will be advised to  exclude the transfer work from the student&rsquo;s academic record. Students  are obligated to report all work from other institutions once enrolled  at UIC.</p>
    <p>When transferring credit from a  community college after attaining junior status, a student must earn at  least 60 of the required semester hours either at the University of  Illinois at Chicago or any other accredited four-year college or  university. The enrollment residence requirements must also be met.  Thus, students ordinarily should not register at a community college  after completing the 
                sophomore year.<br />
    </p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="f" id="f"></a>Secondary Education Program Requirements<br />
    </span>Students who are preparing to teach on the  secondary level enroll in programs supervised by the departments  offering the various majors. These programs, which have state approval  and differ in some respects from those of the arts and sciences  programs, prepare the student for State of Illinois licensure.</p>
    <p>Completion  of a secondary education curriculum leads to either the Bachelor of  Arts or the Bachelor of Science in the teaching of the field of  specialization. The choice of a major determines the particular degree  that will be awarded. Those who complete a secondary education  curriculum may not pursue a second major or curriculum; only  secondary education majors may elect a teacher education minor or endorsement. A  student must choose a major field from the following academic  disciplines: Chemistry, English, French, German, History,  Mathematics, Physics, or Spanish. Detailed information is available  online <a href="https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/catalog/ED.shtml">https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/catalog/ED.shtml</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="g" id="g"></a>College Policies</h2>
    <p>All students in the College of Liberal Arts and  Sciences, whether enrolled as full-time, part-time,  nondegree, or visitor, are  subject to all rules of the college.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="h" id="h"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Academic Load</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">In the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences,  students may enroll in either a part-time or full-time program of  study, in either day or evening classes. During the fall and spring  semesters, a minimum full-time program is 12 semester hours. A program  of 19 semester hours or more must be approved by a college dean or  academic advisor. For Summer Session 1 (four-week) and Summer Session 2  (eight-week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours (5  hours for graduate students) as the minimum number necessary to  constitute full-time enrollment. A program of 13 semester hours or more  during the summer session must be approved by a college dean or  academic advisor.</p>
<p><a name="i" id="i"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules</span></p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3">Probation Rules<br />
    </span>A student will be placed on academic  probation in any term in which either a cumulative or semester grade  point average of less than 2.00/4.00 is earned. The probation rules  apply to all College of Liberal Arts and Sciences students. Academic  probation at UIC cannot be removed by course work from other colleges  or universities, including programs of the Springfield and  Urbana-Champaign campuses.</p>
    <p>A student on  probation is expected to earn at least a 2.00 in the next term if the  UIC cumulative grade point average is a 2.00 or higher. If the UIC  cumulative grade point average is below a 2.00 at the time of  probation, the student must earn greater than a 2.00 during the next term and have a UIC cumulative grade point average of 2.00 by  the end of the second term on probation.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Dismissal Rules</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Students failing to earn a cumulative grade  point average of 2.00 by the end of two terms on probation will be  dismissed from the University. In any term, a student may be dismissed  for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>First-term  students will be dismissed after their first term of enrollment if they  earn zero credit, a grade point average of less than 1.00/4.00, or  obtain a deficit of -15 points or more. Deficit points are calculated  as follows; multiply the number of credit hours for each course taken  by the points for the grade received, A=+2, B=+1, C=0, D=-1, F=-2. Add  the points for each course taken during the semester. The total equals  the deficit points used to determine probation status. Each deficit  point equals one hour of B. </li>
      <li>Continuing  students will be dismissed at the end of any term in which their  cumulative deficit points (see above) are -15 or more.</li>
      <li>Failure to earn any credit.</li>
      <li>Failure to earn at least a 1.00/4.00 (D) average for a term.</li>
      <li>Failure to earn at least a 2.00/4.00 (C) average while on probation.</li>
      <li>Failure to meet conditions of probation. </li>
      <li>Failure to meet conditions specified at the time of admission.</li>
      <li>Failure to make progress toward completion of an LAS degree.</li>
      <li>Failure to declare and make progress in a major after having earned 60 credit hours.</li>
      <li>Two or more consecutive terms of University withdrawals. </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br />
    A student dismissed from a major may not enroll in courses in that major department. Such enrollments will be cancelled on notification from the offering department.</p>
    <p><span style="margin-top: 0;">The dean may waive the dismissal rules in extraordinary circumstances.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Appeal of a Dismissal Decision</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Students who have been dismissed by the  college may apply for readmission after two terms (excluding the summer  session). Students who can document that poor academic performance was  the result of significant extenuating circumstances, such as a  long-term or debilitating illness or personal crisis, may petition for  immediate reinstatement. The student must schedule an interview with an  advisor or dean prior to the first day of instruction of the new term  and provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p><a name="j" id="j"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Change of Course Schedule</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Adding Courses</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students may add courses for which they have  met the prerequisite(s) if seats are still available during the first  two weeks of the fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of  Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. Students  should seek approval of the instructor to enroll in a class after the  fifth day of the semester since some courses prohibit enrollment during the  second week in accordance with college policy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Dropping Courses </span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Undergraduate students may drop courses  using<em> my.UIC </em>through the end of the second week of  classes for fall and spring semesters, or through the first Wednesday  of Summer Session 1 and the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During  weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters 
semesters (first Thursday through the  second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop  courses with the permission of the  college. If the drop occurs  between 0&ndash;2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the  transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and  spring, a W is noted on the transcript. During their entire undegraduate degree program, undergraduate students may drop  a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on  their transcript.  These drop requests are approved, regardless of the circumstances,  provided that the student meets with an LAS academic advisor or dean  within the designated period and that the student has not exceeded the  limit of four late drops. The merits of the student&rsquo;s request are not a  factor in determining eligibility to late drop.</p>
<p>Because  only four exceptions to the designated deadlines are available to  students over the entire period in which they are enrolled at UIC,  students are advised to evaluate their academic standing in the course  with the instructor before requesting to exercise one of these four  late drops.</p>
    <p>Requests to drop a course  after the tenth week of the fall and spring semesters, or requests to  drop a course within the approved exception period in excess of the  four 
    automatic drops are not routinely granted unless there are  exceptional circumstances outside of the student&rsquo;s control that can be  documented. Requests require a written petition and are reviewed by the  committee on petitions. Poor performance in a course is not a  sufficient reason to  approve a request.</p>
    <p>Course drop deadlines that apply to summer sessions are announced by the Office of the Registrar on its website <a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/registration/policies_procedures.html">http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/registration/policies_procedures.html</a>.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="k" id="k"></a>Change of Major</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students seeking to change or add a major should declare the new major  with the department offering that major. Some programs require that  specific requirements be fulfilled in order to declare and/or be retained as a  major.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="l" id="l"></a>Class Attendance</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Each instructor may establish his/her own  attendance policy, including penalties for nonattendance. Failure to  attend class does not result in automatic withdrawal from a course.  The college expects that students will attend all classes.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="m" id="m"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Closed Courses</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Overenrollment into a closed course or attendance in such a course is prohibited. Retroactive registration is not allowed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="n" id="n"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Course Prerequisites</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A student must satisfy the prerequisites before enrolling in a course.  A student enrolling in a course without having met the prerequisites  may be withdrawn from the course without prior notification. Course prerequisites are listed in  both the <em>Course Descriptions</em> section of the  catalog and the <em>Schedule of Classes </em>in<em> my.UIC</em>. Only the instructor may waive a prerequisite, if given 
                  evidence that the student is adequately prepared to 
    pursue the subject. <strong>Warning:</strong> Registration in a course without meeting prerequisites does not imply approval of the registration.</p>
<p><a name="o" id="o"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Credit/No Credit Option</span><br />
  The credit/no credit option allows the  student to complete a course with a grade of credit (CR) or no credit  (NC) instead of a letter grade. Courses completed with a grade of CR  carry credit and apply toward degree requirements. In general, grades  of CR and NC are final and cannot be changed to letter grades. College  policy coincides with campus policy with the following conditions:</p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Only  students in good standing may elect to take a course under the  credit/no credit option. Students on probation and those whose status  is undetermined at the time at which they elect the option 
      are not eligible.</li>
      <li>A student may request only one course per term as credit/no credit.</li>
      <li>No more than two courses in a single discipline may be taken as credit/no credit.</li>
      <li>Only  elective courses may be taken on a credit/no credit basis; courses  being used to meet any graduation course requirements must be taken for  letter grades.</li>
      <li>The following describes the restrictions that apply to all students, regardless of major or curriculum: 
                    <ul>
                      <li>Students may not take English 160 or 161 as credit/no credit.</li>
                      <li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the foreign language requirement as credit/no credit.</li>
                      <li>Students  may not take any course used to satisfy the General Education Core  requirements as credit/no credit. Until students have completed the  minimum requirement in each General Education Core category, courses  from these areas may not be taken as credit/no credit. </li>
                      <li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the Quantitative Reasoning requirement as credit/no credit. </li>
                      <li>Students  may not take any course being used to satisfy the requirements of the  major, minor, or the required prerequisite and collateral courses of  the major as credit/no credit. </li>
      <li>Students  in the health sciences curricula are advised not to complete required  science courses under the credit/no credit option.</li></ul></li>
      <li>A student may earn no more than 21 semester hours of credit at UIC under the credit/no credit option.</li>
    </ol>
<p>Students must apply to take a course credit/no credit at the college  office, third floor, University Hall, no later than the tenth day of the  term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer  Session 2). After that date, students may not request courses on a  credit/no credit basis nor may they change a credit/no credit request  previously submitted. It is the responsibility of the student to  determine eligibility under the regulations. Students requesting a  course under the credit/no credit option will be informed if they are  ineligible and will receive a grade for the course. Students with  questions concerning their eligibility should make an appointment with  a college advisor. Instructors are not informed that a student has elected this option; the final grade is converted to CR/NC.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="p" id="p"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Declaring a Major</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">While a student may begin taking courses in  the major at any time, a student must declare a major no later than the  completion of 60 semester hours. Transfer students entering with 60  semester hours or more must declare a major by the end of their first  term at UIC. Some majors, however, require department approval for  admission into the program. Currently, this special approval is only  required for the secondary education program in Mathematics and for 
    all  programs in the Departments of Biological Sciences; Communication; and Criminology, Law, and  Justice. To declare a major, the student should visit the office of the  department offering the major and complete a major declaration form.  Failure to  declare a major after earning 60 semester hours will result in a  registration hold for the following semester, unless an  exception has been approved by an LAS advisor.</p>
<p>The  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences reserves the right to restrict  enrollment of students into its academic programs based on space  availability. Enrollment restrictions may be placed during the  University admission process or on undeclared continuing students.                </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Double Major</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A student may declare a second major with  the approval of the college office. An additional major will not be  approved if the first major and the proposed second major involve  similar study or substantial duplication of course work. With few  exceptions, an additional major will not be approved if the first major  and proposed second major are in the same department. Students in a  specialized curriculum cannot have a second major. A student declaring  a degree program defined as a specialized curriculum may not have a  second specialized curriculum program. Minors that have substantial  overlap with the specialized curriculum content are not allowed. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Double Degrees</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A student may receive two degrees  concurrently from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The student  must complete 30 semester hours of credit at UIC beyond the  requirements for the first degree in courses not offered for the first  degree. In addition, the student must complete all degree requirements  of the college and the major department. For specific information on  these requirements, consult the department listings in the catalog.</p>
<p>Double  degrees will not be approved if the first degree and the proposed  second degree involve study of a similar area or substantial  duplication of course work. The student must consult an academic  advisor in the college office to initiate a request for double degrees.  The college does not approve requests for more than two bachelor&rsquo;s  degrees.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Second Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A  student with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from UIC or another  institution may receive a second bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the College of  Liberal Arts and Sciences subsequent to the first undergraduate degree.  The student must complete 30 semester hours of credit at UIC beyond the  requirements for the first degree in courses not offered for the first  degree. In addition, the student must complete all degree requirements  of the college and the major department. For specific information on  these requirements, consult the department listings in the catalog.</p>
<p>A  second bachelor&rsquo;s degree will not be approved if the first degree and  the proposed second degree involve study of a similar area or  substantial duplication of course work. The student must consult an  academic advisor in the college office to initiate a request for a  second degree. The college does not approve requests for more than two  bachelor&rsquo;s degrees,&nbsp;nor for bachelor's degrees&nbsp;subsequent to a graduate degree.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="qq2" id="qq2"></a>Rules Governing the Major</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">The major consists of discipline-specific  courses, excluding required prerequisite and collateral courses outside  of the major department. Specialized curricula include all courses  required for the undergraduate degree. Elective courses within a specialized curriculum may be used toward a minor. Degree program listings in the  department sections address these differences.</p>
<p>A  liberal arts and sciences degree program may not include less than 27  or more than 40 semester hours of course work in the major field and 36  semester hours of prerequisites and collateral course work. For those  departments and programs that require prerequisites and collateral  courses, the total field of specialization may not exceed 72 semester  hours. Writing-in-the-Discipline courses may be excluded from this  limitation. The major, exclusive of collateral courses, must include 14  semester hours of upper-division (200-, 300-, or 400-level) courses.  Specialized curricula must meet the minimum requirements for graduation  in the college. The maximum number of hours allowed in a specialized  curriculum will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <span class="clsSubHead3">Double Major<br />
    </span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Cross-listed courses may count toward  specific requirements in each major; however, in such cases a  cross-listed course counts toward the total hours required in only one  of the majors. A student need not repeat course work or duplicate  requirements to complete the second major.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <span class="clsSubHead3">Students Enrolled in Other Colleges </span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students in other UIC colleges may not  officially complete an LAS major or curriculum. These students may,  however, be eligible to receive at the time of graduation a letter of  certification verifying completion of the program of study provided  that all course requirements are satisfied and that the student has met  the minimum grade point average requirements. A letter of certification  will not be authorized if the student&rsquo;s program in the primary college  and the proposed LAS program involve similar study or include  substantial duplication of course work. Students in other UIC colleges  can complete an LAS minor when approved by the student&rsquo;s college.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="r" id="r"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Graduate-Level Courses 
                  for
    Undergraduate Credit</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">With department approval, an undergraduate  student may enroll in a course in the Graduate College (500-level) for  undergraduate elective credit. Prior to enrollment, students must  obtain approval and must have met course prerequisites.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Students  should understand that graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate  student are generally not applicable toward a graduate degree, except in designated joint degree programs.<br />
      <br />
    <span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="ra" id="ra"></a>Cross-Listed Courses</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Courses cross-listed in two or more departments have equivalent  standing in each department and are treated as the same course  regardless of the department under which the registration occurs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="s" id="s"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Independent Study Course Options</span></p>
    <p>A number of departments offer  independent study course options (research, field experience, internship, and  independent study) in which a student&rsquo;s special interests may be pursued under  the direction of a faculty member. To enroll in such a course in any UIC  college, the LAS student must have a minimum 2.50/4.00 grade point average in  all course work taken at UIC and must obtain consent of the instructor and the  department offering the course prior to registration. No student may enroll in  an independent study course option after the tenth day of the term without  approval of the department and the dean&rsquo;s office.</p>
    <p>A maximum of 8  semester hours in any of the independent study course options in a given  department or program may count toward the degree. No more than 16 semester  hours of independent study credit may apply toward the degree. Because many of  these courses may not be repeated, students should consult the catalog for  specific credit limitations. Please note fieldwork and internship courses that  are specifically required in the major as stated in this catalog are excluded  from this limitation.                </p>

    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Any rule, regulation, or action of the college may be appealed in  writing. Petitions are submitted to the Office of the Dean, LAS Student  Academic Affairs, third floor, University Hall. It is the student&rsquo;s  responsibility to provide documentation in support of a petition.  Submission of a petition does not imply approval.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="u" id="u"></a>Proficiency Examinations</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">LAS departments may offer proficiency  examinations, which are similar in content to regularly scheduled final  course exams. To take such an exam, however, a student must meet the  eligibility requirements of both the college and department.  Consideration for such approval includes a careful review of the  student&rsquo;s secondary and postsecondary records. If approval is granted,  the minimum passing grade that a student must earn is a C, although a  department may require a higher passing grade. When credit is awarded,  a grade of P (Pass) is assigned. The Pass grade is not included in a  student&rsquo;s grade point average, but the credit may apply toward the  total hours required for graduation. Note that proficiency credit does  not apply toward nor interrupt the 30-hour enrollment residence  requirement for graduation.</p>
<p>Although  other limitations apply, proficiency exams may not be taken by a  student who has credit for more than one course in the subject above  the level of the course in which the exam is required. For more  detailed information on eligibility criteria, consult <em>Proficiency  Examinations for Enrolled Students</em> in the <em>Academic Standing</em> section.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A student who has placed into the 104 or  higher level of a foreign language taught at UIC as the result of the  UIC administered placement tests may receive academic proficiency  credits for prerequisite courses.</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Placement  into the 104-level provides four  hours of proficiency credit for  the 103-level course  if the  student completes the 104 course with a grade of B or higher.</li>
      <li>Placement  at the 200-level, i.e., student has satisfied the college foreign  language requirement through placement testing, provides four hours of  proficiency credit for the 103-level course and four hours of  proficiency credit for the 104-level course if the student completes  the 200-level course with a grade of B or higher. These credits also  apply for placement into the last semester of a heritage basic language  course sequence.</li>
      <li>These credits are  awarded only for courses taught at UIC and only on the basis of new  student placement test results for those with no prior college-level  foreign language credits. The credits may be applied only to the first  language course taken.</li>
      <li>Proficiency  credits appear as &ldquo;P&rdquo; on the transcript and are not calculated into the  grade point average. Proficiency credit does not apply to placements  based on AP, SAT, or IB scores for which credits are applied in a  prescribed manner or to international students for their native  language. CLEP credits are not accepted for foreign language courses.</li>
      <li>Students  to whom this section applies must initiate the request for the credits  after the completion of the required course by obtaining the  appropriate request form from an academic advisor in the LAS Academic  Advising Center, third floor, University Hall.</li>

    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students may repeat a course to increase  their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under  which repeating a course is advisable and to a student&rsquo;s advantage.  There are also circumstances in which repeating a course may disadvantage  a student and narrow a student&rsquo;s options. Some colleges require  students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic  advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>
<p>Courses in which a student earned a grade of  A or B  may not be repeated. In LAS, courses with a C grade  may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once  without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for the  course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The  original grade will be calculated into the grade point average, unless  the student initiates a request for <em>Repeating a Course with Grade Point  Average Recalculation</em> as described below. Only one registration for the  course counts toward the total number of credits required for  graduation. A student may not repeat a course  after receiving credit in a  course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.</p>
    <p>To  repeat a course more than once requires written permission from the  student&rsquo;s college dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal  on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not  be repeated; students should consult their college before repeating a  course.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3"><a name="w" id="w2"></a>Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Important Note:</strong> Grade  point average recalculation for a repeated course <strong>is not</strong> automatic. The  student must initiate a request in the college office as outlined below.</p>
<p> For the grade point average recalculation policy to apply, a student must   declare to his or her college the intent to repeat a course for a change of   grade. Students must submit this request to their college before the end of the   official add/drop period, no later than the second Friday of the fall and spring   semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of   Summer Session 2.  The course must be  repeated within three semesters of the receipt of the original grade,  and it must be taken at UIC. Only one registration for the course  counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.</p>
    <p>Undergraduate  students are allowed grade point average recalculation in a maximum of four  repeated courses. Under the course repeat policy, all courses taken and  their grades appear on the transcript in the semester in which they  were taken. Under the grade point average recalculation policy, the  grade earned the first time the course was taken will be dropped from  the calculation of the cumulative GPA and the grade(s) earned when the  course was repeated will be used in the calculation. This rule holds,  even if the second grade is lower than the first. If a course is  repeated more than once, the first grade is not counted in the GPA, but  all other grades for that course are calculated in the cumulative GPA.</p>

    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Intercollege Transfer Students</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students currently enrolled at UIC who want  to transfer into the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences should  complete an Intercollege Transfer Application available at LAS  Reception, third floor, University Hall. Students are welcome to discuss  possible admission to LAS with an academic advisor. Requests must be  initiated by the Friday of the eleventh week of the fall and spring  semesters and the fourth week of the summer session. Admission to LAS  is generally limited to those students in good academic standing who  have a UIC grade point average of at least 2.00/4.00 and whose combined  UIC and transfer grade point average is at least 2.00. Those students  who are accepted into LAS are expected to enroll immediately in courses  that fulfill LAS degree requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Students from Other Colleges and Universities</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students applying to the college as  transfers&mdash;those who will have earned at least 36 semester hours or 54  quarter hours of credit by the time of enrollment&mdash;must submit complete transcripts from all  postsecondary institutions. Provided space is available, a minimum  2.50/4.00 grade point average is required for consideration. Please  consult the <em>Admissions</em> section of the catalog for more information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transferring out of the College</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">An LAS student who wants to transfer into  another UIC college must follow the procedures of that college. Most  UIC health sciences programs admit students only in the fall semester.  For information on application procedures and deadlines, consult the  admissions office serving the UIC health sciences colleges or the LAS  Academic Advising Center, third floor, University Hall. Students  interested in colleges other than the health sciences should contact  those colleges directly.</p>
<p class="clsSubHead"><a name="aa" id="aa"></a>Preprofessional Studies</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Preprofessional studies are designed for students  who intend to pursue their undergraduate or graduate education in  professional schools of the University of Illinois. Preprofessional  areas are not major areas of study for the proposed degrees and are  designated as educational goals in student records. Preprofessional  study is offered in the following areas: </p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Pre-Dentistry</li>
      <li>Pre-Health Information Management</li>
      <li>Pre-Law</li>
      <li>Pre-Medicine</li>
      <li>Pre-Nursing</li>
      <li>Pre-Nutrition</li>
      <li>Pre-Occupational Therapy</li>
      <li>Pre-Pharmacy</li>
      <li>Pre-Physical Therapy</li>
      <li>Pre-Public Health</li>
      <li>Pre-Urban and Public Affairs</li>
      <li>Pre-Veterinary Medicine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Advisors  for students in these areas are available in the LAS Academic Advising  Center to answer students&rsquo; questions about admissions requirements and  procedures and to assist students in planning their programs of study.  Many of the professional schools encourage prospective students to  visit their college offices in order to obtain more detailed  information on the programs. Preprofessional students should consult an  LAS advisor regarding any changes in professional school admissions  requirements.</p>
    <p>Designation of a   preprofessional area does not guarantee admission to a professional  school, nor does completion of the required course work or attainment  of the minimum grade point average. Preprofessional students should  follow an LAS degree program whether or not a bachelor&rsquo;s degree is  required for admission to the professional program. Once 60 semester  hours are earned, an LAS major must be declared.</p>
    <p>Because  application procedures as well as deadlines vary among the professional  schools of the University of Illinois, students are encouraged to  consult both an LAS preprofessional advisor and the individual program  to which application is planned. Students who are members of  underrepresented groups in the health professions and plan to enter one  of the health science fields should also consult the <em>Urban Health Program</em> information in the <em>Academic Planning and Progress</em> section of the catalog.</p>

<p class="clsSubHead"><a name="ae" id="ae"></a>Minors</p>
<p>Although a minor is not required, a student may  elect to complete one or more minors. The number of semester hours  required for the LAS minor is 12 to 21. LAS students may complete a  minor in another college, with the approval of that college. A teacher  education minor, however, may be completed only by a secondary  education major. Also, with few exceptions, a minor will not be  approved if the student&rsquo;s major and proposed minor are in the same  department. The following are minors offered by LAS. Additional rules governing the minor are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cross-listed       courses used toward the minor must be distinct from the courses used to       satisfy the major.</li>
  <li>Courses       used for the major may not be used to fulfill semester hour requirements       of a minor.</li>
  <li>A minor accompanying       a specialized curriculum or teaching curriculum may use elective courses       only from the curriculum toward that minor.</li>

<p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  encourages the intellectual growth and development of the student as an  individual.  To arrange  an advising appointment, students may call (312) 996-3366, or come to  the LAS Academic Advising Center, third floor, University Hall. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="ai" id="ai"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Advising Policy</span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Newly admitted students are required to participate in an orientation advising session prior to their initial registration. Students should consult a college advisor at  least once during their first term in residence and at least once an  academic year thereafter. Students with a declared major should consult  regularly with their departmental advisor as well. Some students may be  required to consult an advisor in order to register for a subsequent  term. Unless specifically exempted, all LAS freshman are required to  meet with a college advisor during their first two semesters in order  to register for the following semester.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to take advantage of  the full services of the college advising office prior to the time of  registration and at other times when assistance might prove fruitful. The  college strongly recommendsÂ that  students with junior standing meet with a college academic advisor for a review  of progress toward the degree. Students who have chosen a major must also  consult with a departmental advisor prior to registration.</p>
<p>LAS  advisors assist students not only in individual program planning and  course selection, but also are able to discuss with the student the  feasibility of various career paths based on interest and academic  performance. Additionally, advisors can explain college rules and  requirements as they pertain to various programs and can help resolve  special registration problems. In conjunction with this, advisors refer  students to additional sources of help on campus.</p>
<p>Students  who want help in choosing a major or who want to examine various  career, vocational, and professional options should arrange to see one  of the specialized counselors who provide such guidance. These  counselors are available in the Counseling Center and Career Services  located in the Student Services Building.</p>
<p>The responsibility for  selecting courses and meeting graduation requirements rests with the  students, who must plan intelligently to make their programs consistent  with their goals and with college requirements. All LAS students should  obtain a Degree Audit Report System (DARS) analysis from an academic  advisor in the college at least annually. This analysis of earned  credits can assist students in planning their program of study. DARS  reports obtained online should be confirmed by a college advisor.</p>
