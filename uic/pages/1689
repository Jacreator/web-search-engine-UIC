  <i><font color="#000000">(Beta Version)</font></i></h2>
<p>A paper presented at ACM's SIGCSE Conference describing the Web Annotator can 
  be found as a MS Word <a href="p70reed.doc">document</a> (474KB), or a <a href="p70reed.pdf">pdf 
  file</a> (500KB).</p>
<p>To use Web Annotator, you must be using Internet Explorer 5.5 (or greater) 
  on Windows. To share your annotations with others, you need to have a server 
  running (not part of this installation yet).<br>
</p>
<p>To install, right-click on this<a href="WebAnnotatorSetup.zip"></a> 1 Meg <a href="WebAnnotatorSetup.zip">zip 
  file</a> to save it to your disk.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unzip to some directory</li>
  <li>Go to that directory and go into the WebAnnotatorSetup folder</li>
  <li>Select the Setup program.</li>
  <li>Choose a directory into which you will install the Annotator program. The 
    http server address can be left blank for now. There is an unsupported demo 
    server address you can use (for now) at http://muffin.ai.uic.edu:8080/Annotator/AnnotatorExtension</li>
  <li>That's it! Now launch Internet Explorer (IE).</li>
  <li>From within IE, go to the <i>View</i> menu, and select the <i>Toolbars</i> 
    submenu. Select <i>Annotate</i>.</li>
  <li>Start your annotations!<br>
  </li>
  <p>For help, see the rightmost icon on the Annotator toolbar. These can also 
    be found by selecting the yellow &quot;WebAnnotator&quot; question mark in 
    the installation directory.</p>
