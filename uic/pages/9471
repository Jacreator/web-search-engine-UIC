  <LI>This version of these course notes was assembled Spring 2005
  by <A HREF="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell">John Bell</A>, for
  CS 488 at the University of Illinois Chicago.
  <LI>Much of the material in these course notes was provided by
  Andy Johnson, from his CS 488 course web pages. His original
  pages can be found at <A HREF="http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/488/index.html">http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/488/index.html</A>
  <LI>Some material is recycled from the <A HREF="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/Courses/Eng591_F1999/index.html">Virtual
  Reality Programming course ( Eng 591 )</A> that I taught at the
  University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
  <LI>The required textbook for this course is &quot;Computer Graphics,
  Principles and Practice&quot; by Foley, vanDam, Feiner, and Hughes.
  Some material in these pages was taken from that book.
  <LI>Some material was taken from the current literature in the
  field of computer graphics and similar sources. Accreditation
  for these items is provided where such material appears.

<H3>Andy's Art Collection</H3>

<P>When Andy Johnson teaches this course, he provides artistic
examples of computer graphics for each lesson in his course. Rather
than taking his images, many of which were provided to him by
third parties, links are provided here to each of his art pages:</P>
