Millions of people around the world die from non-communicable diseases that could have been diagnosed and treated. Although these conditions are often thought of as a rural phenomenon, many people living in urban poverty cannot afford health treatment or care and there are few nonprofits available to work toward a solution for them. Motivated to solve this global problem, Honors College student Rahul Patel will join a UIC team of four other students in the annual competition for the Hult Prize on March 7-8th in San Francisco. The Hult Prize serves as an opportunity for aspiring students from universities across the nation to come together and solve serious issues faced by billions of people worldwide. The 2014 Hult Prize winner will be chosen by former President Bill Clinton on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, which encourages students to develop solutions to improve care for people living in impoverished urban areas worldwide.</p>
<p>Participants in the Hult Competition form teams of four to five people within their university and submit an application. After the first round of the competition narrowed the field from 10,000 to 300 teams, this year’s UIC team qualified for the regional competition in California. This is one of six regional competitions at which teams will give their presentations. One team will be</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>chosen from each of the regional competitions to move on to the final competition, which will be hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting in September 2014. The winning team will receive $1,000,000 awarded by former President Clinton himself to implement their healthcare solutions and change the lives of people around the world.</p>
<p>The members of the UIC team, including Patel, will present their idea to implement health kiosks in urban areas where people cannot afford healthcare. Their idea—called “Qube”— will reflect a business model that aims to bring down the cost of healthcare as well as diagnose and treat non-communicable diseases more efficiently for people who cannot ordinarily afford treatment.</p>
<p>Honors College Dean Bette L. Bottoms stated proudly that, “to be among only 300 teams chosen from 10,000 who entered this worthwhile competition is extraordinary. But it is not unexpected—UIC students are every bit as prepared and creative as their competition from Stanford, Harvard, and other universities of historical prominence, but [are] far more engaged with and understanding of today’s socially significant problems, especially those that are health-related.” Best of luck to Rahul and the UIC team at the regional competition!</p>

<p>With today’s economy, it is easy to overlook opportunities like studying abroad. Many students may wonder who has the time or budget to visit another country for an entire semester. Fortunately, there exists a scholarship that assists hard-working students from low-income families in paying for their study abroad experiences. The Gilman Program is invested in providing study abroad opportunities for traditionally underrepresented student groups with each award averaging $4,000. In order to be eligible for the Gilman Scholarship a student must demonstrate an excellent academic history and be a Federal Pell Grant recipient.</p>
<p>The Gilman Scholarship was the determining factor as to whether or not I could go abroad, and without it I would not have been able to spend my Fall 2013 semester in Barcelona, Spain conducting research on cross-cultural perspectives for the treatment of various mental illnesses. The lessons learned abroad are so incredibly valuable that no amount of credit hours can account for them. For example, we touched on theories of cultural relativism in my psychology classes and I was able to concretely put these theories into practice while interacting with locals on a day-to-day basis. It was the application of these concepts that made the lessons all the more effective and relevant to my future Capstone project.</p>
<p>With opportunities like the Gilman Scholarship, we are reminded that studying abroad is an experience that no student should feel excluded from. If you are interested in studying abroad there are a variety of scholarships available to all students, including through the Honors College. Visit the Study Abroad Office website for more details: http://www.uic.edu/depts/spec_prog/studyabroad/</p>

		<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kerry-gawne1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-586 alignleft" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kerry-gawne1.png" alt="kerry gawne" width="296" height="300" /></a>One of the first things that stands out about UIC senior Kerry Gawne when meeting her is her perpetual enthusiasm, which carries over to her education and involvement outside the classroom. A German major with minors in art history, English, and history, Gawne has a plethora of experiences and credentials. These qualifications helped her win a scholarship from the national German honor society, Delta Phi Alpha—the only one awarded in the nation. The scholarship is awarded on the basis of overall academic merit and the advancement and dedication of the student to the study of the German language and culture. Gawne will use the scholarship provision towards her continuing studies at Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany where she will begin a Master’s program in European history this fall.</p>
<p>Gawne spoke eagerly of the study abroad program she was a part of this previous summer in Berlin, Germany. She described her schedule during the month-long program organized by the UIC Department of Germanic Studies and hosted by the Humboldt University in Berlin: her mornings consisted of language instruction; during the afternoon and evenings Gawne and her classmates went on unique cultural excursions that other tourists wouldn’t be privy to—including watching films, visiting flea markets, and attending lectures about specific sites and regions. Another aspect of the program that Gawne relished was the fact that she had roommates from Prague and Paris, with whom she made lifelong friendships.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>In addition to studying abroad, Gawne has also been substantially involved with student organizations during her four years at UIC. She is currently the secretary and treasurer of the Student Centers Board and has been involved with Trade Winds, an organization through which students can mentor international students and make cross-cultural connections. She has also previously conducted research with Dr. David M. Sokol, Professor Emeritus of Art History, on the works of the German expressionist artist Otto Neumann. Cataloging the name, dimensions, and medium of each of the</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Society artist’s pieces were among the duties Gawne was assigned during her research experience. Additionally, she was a YP4 (Young People For) Fellow during her junior year, which she describes as “a year-long national fellowship for progressive youth leadership [rooted] in the ideals of social justice and being agents of change in our local communities.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The scholarship Gawne has received from Delta Phi Alpha will be an investment toward her postgraduate education which, in turn, will be an asset for her long-term goals. Gawne is interested in pursuing a career devoted to cross-cultural communication and someday wants to start a nonprofit organization dedicated to conflict resolution between ethnic groups, focusing on bridging gaps and helping people learn about other cultures. Advice she would give her peers would be to embrace diversity and interact with people from different backgrounds to gain new perspectives on life and develop a sense of empathy for others.</p>

		<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fransely-Robles-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-515" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fransely-Robles-1.png" alt="Fransely Robles-1" width="300" height="199" /></a>Fransely Robles, an Honors College senior, was awarded the 2013 UIC Lincoln Academy Student Laureate on November 2, 2013 in Springfield, Illinois. This honor, given to only one senior in each of the four-year colleges and universities in Illinois, recognizes academic excellence and dedication to public service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Robles is actively involved across the UIC community. From working as an office assistant in several of the UIC colleges, to leading a number of student- focused organizations including Agape House, to serving on the Chancellor’s Committee on the Status of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer People,and Allies, Robles has embodied the Honors College spirit of engagement. A commuter student, Robles has also maintained a stellar GPA while being a leader on campus as an Honors College Ambassador and admissions assistant.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, Robles’s work is not limited to the UIC campus. Robles has a passion for activism, advocating for the rights of youth through a variety of causes such as the Dyke March and the Undocumented Chicago March. In addition, Robles has facilitated sexual education workshops in Chicago Public Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although this is not Robles’s first award or honor, the Lincoln Academy Student Laureate signifies the upcoming end of their journey at the Honors College. As a bilingual first-generation college student, Robles plans to pursue their interest in queer theory and the intersections of religion, sexuality, and gender by attending graduate school and eventually becoming a professor of gender and women’s studies. Robles also plans to continue their off-campus activities by mentoring LGBTQ youth in a congregation within the community. Robles stated, “Receiving the Lincoln Laureate as an Honors College student is a testimony to the strength, readiness, and preparation that the Honors College has instilled in me.” Robles ultimately encourages Honors College students to become leaders on campus and to be active within the Honors College during their college experience.</span></p>
