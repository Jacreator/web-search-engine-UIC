<blockquote>
  <p>We have an engaging message geared towards encouraging students to consider taking more Computer Science classes in High School, combining puzzles, hands-on activities, videos, and other visual examples.<br>
    Please contact us if you would like a visit to your  classes.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>...The presentations have been engaging, exciting, and the students love them.  Dr. Reed helps put a human touch to the notion of studying Computer Science at the college level.  ...I encourage teachers of all grades to invite Dr. Reed to visit their classes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - <em>Jeff Solin</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Board Certified Teacher, Computer Science Department, Northside College Prep </p>
    <p>Professor Reed brings a certain charisma to his presentation that keeps the students mesmerized.  Many of my students didn't want to leave after the bell rang because they had so many questions for him.  His presentation was both dynamic and packed full of useful information.  ... His presentation left students with a sense of magical wonder in technology which is exactly what we need to instill in this future generation.<br>
  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - Stirling Crow</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Von Steuben Metro Science Center<br>
  <br>
  ...Several parents came into parent-teacher conferences telling me  that their students are now considering pursuing computer science in  college.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <em>Doug Allee</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oak Park / River Forest High School<br>
    </p>
    <p> ... Long  after the enthusiasm generated by your visit, a number of students  (months later) come in with questions they have from exploring college  CS curriculums on line.<br>
    <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sam Polki</em>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lane Tech High School, Computer Science Teacher</p>
    <p>...Excellent job.&nbsp; He has a thorough knowledge of the     subject and captivated his audience... I wish I was going back to college....<br>

  <p>What are career options in Computing? <a href="http://computingcareers.acm.org/">ACM</a> addresses this question.</p>
  <p>What is the difference between different computer-related majors? See the excellent Computer Curricula 2005 Report on <a href="http://www.acm.org/education/curricula.html">this</a> page (or locally <a href="CC2005-March06Final.pdf">here</a> [pdf]) that describes the difference between Computer Engineering (CE), 
    Computer Science (CS), 
    Information Systems (IS), 
    Information Technology (IT), and 
  Software Engineering (SE).</p>
  <p>Diversity has its advantages, as CS Dept. Head Pete Nelson comments in this Chicago Sun Times editorial <a href="AdvantagesOfDiversity.htm">article</a>. </p>

  <p>At UIC we are part of the IMPACTS Alliance<span class="style3">*</span>, a consortium of Chicago-area universities supporting CS education. When looking at school options, it is important to find the best fit. For each school consider average ACT, private vs. public, average class size, cost, and program emphasis. Here are some options for you to pursue for a Computer Science degree in the Chicago area, listed in alphabetical order:</p>

<h3><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Why take Computer Science Classes in High  School?</strong><br>
      <br>
    Two years ago Money magazine chose Software Engineering as the best job in America,  considering salary, job growth, stress, flexibility, creativity, and ease of  entry.&nbsp; Computer jobs today are the fastest growing, highest-paid jobs. The average starting salary in  Computer Science is $59K.<br>
    <br>
    Computers today are essential in almost any career.&nbsp; Nurses who are computer literate have  advantages over their co-workers who aren&rsquo;t; Businesses rely heavily on  computers; Teachers use them for instruction.&nbsp;  High School computer courses are an excellent preparation to give you  the level of computer knowledge that Universities and top employers will  expect.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Yes, but how about the dot-com bust, and  out-sourcing to other countries?</strong><br>
      <br>
    There are more workers in Information Technology (IT) &nbsp;today than there were at the height of the  dot-com era.&nbsp; While it is true that  lower-level programming jobs are being outsourced to other countries, jobs that  require higher-order thinking are going unfilled.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How about in the future?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t Computer Science declining?</strong><br>
      <br>
    There was a surge in Computer Science in the 80&rsquo;s, then again in the late  90&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <br>
    US Dept. Commerce forecasts between 2006 and 2016 indicate that 2 out of the 4  fastest growing jobs are computer related, with many other computer jobs in the top 25 fastest growing jobs.<br>  
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How about Project Lead the Way (PLTW)?&nbsp; How does that compare to Computer Science?</strong><br>
    <br>
    PLTW is designed to encourage students to consider general engineering and  technology, but is not computer specific.&nbsp; If you are a student who  already knows you are interested in CS, taking CS courses in High School can  give you a head start, particularly when taking Programming Courses.<br>  
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What about the idea that all you do in  Computer Science is sit in front of a terminal in a office cubicle?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Thinking that Computer Scientists only sit in front of a computer all day can  be compared to thinking that carpenters only hammer nails all day, or biologists  only look at test tubes all day.&nbsp;  Computer Science is a vast field that includes:  </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Applications:        Internet technology, Making Computers Smarter (Artificial Intelligence), Organizing        large amounts of information using databases, (e.g. Google), Computer        Graphics (e.g. Computer Games, iPod interfaces);</li>
          <li>Architecture:        Building new computer systems and networks</li>
          <li>Figuring        out how to make computer programs and systems run better (e.g. completing        allowing the Humane Genome project to be finished many years early)<br>
          </li>
        </ol>
  <p>Check out <a href="http://computingcareers.acm.org/">descriptions from the ACM</a> of what computer scientists do. See also <a href="http://www.imageofcomputing.com/resources.html">http://www.imageofcomputing.com/resources.html</a><br>
  </p>
  <li><strong>If I'm interested in working in the Gaming industry, do I have to major in Gaming in college?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Gaming is a very fast-paced and demanding area of Computer Science and requires  that you are knowledgeable in math and skilled in programming, using advanced  data structures.&nbsp; Taking advanced math  classes and working on your programming skills are good ways to prepare. Gaming companies are more interested in you having a solid foundation as an expert programmer than they are in you having a gaming major. See <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/spiff/fear/courses.html">recommended courses</a> for UIC Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL) students for an idea about this program.<br>
