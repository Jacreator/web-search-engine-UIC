Everyone we encountered in our Pulmonary and Critical Care rotation was extremely welcoming and accommodating. This was such a wonderful opportunity to be able to shadow the physicians and identify potential solutions to improve the patient care in the hospital. Our final presentation to our mentor and to the rest of the members of the program was very successful and we were excited to share our observations and solutions. We look forward to continue this effort and implement our designs.</p>

During one of the appointments, a patient mentioned that he had stopped taking his medication, missed his scheduled tests, and had not seen a primary care physician for some time. This particular interaction stood out to me because it was very clear that the physicians were concerned about this patient and were trying their best to convince him to be more involved in taking care of his health (especially to avoid a previous health issue from happening again). Although the patient said that he would start going to a doctor regularly and taking medications, it was still a worry that he would not. In general, the physicians were concerned that the patients were not following instructions in their care plan. </p>
<p>During the procedures for this week, we were given an opportunity to assist the physicians a little bit during one of the bronchoscopies (filling syringes with saline, lidocaine). It was a great opportunity to be able to be a little involved in the procedure and help the physicians with a procedure that we have seen so many times during this clinical experience. The Attending and Fellow were extremely clear with what they wanted prepared and showed me exactly what was needed prior to the procedure itself.</p>
<p>I look forward to preparing our final presentation and appreciate the clinical experience.   </p>

The importance of communication between the Fellows, Residents, Interns and Medical Students (Fourth Year) was extremely clear. I have noticed that the &#8220;Fellows Room&#8221; is an extremely important place for them. They discuss every patient, ask questions about care plans, discuss with other departments via phone and fully discuss the patients prior to seeing them for consultations. This is also the area where the Fellows explain various concepts and field questions from the Residents, Interns, and Students. Throughout this week so far (as well as in other weeks), I have observed that the Fellows gladly answer any questions and make clarifications, and are able to do so in a more relaxed environment in the Fellow Room.</p>
<p>In the first clinic, the Nurse Practitioner suggested a color scheme for the inhaler stickers that we mentioned last week. She mentioned that it may be nice to have the Controller (C) stickers to be green and the Rescue (R) inhalers to be red, for it to be easy for the patients to identify the color and letter on the side of their inhaler. She also told us about a &#8220;smart pill&#8221; that has begun to be offered at Rush University Medical Center that alerts the patient when they forget to ingest a pill. It was interesting to think about the possible elimination of patients forgetting to use their inhalers or other medications if such a technology were introduced to UI Health System. One of the Fellows showed us how to tell the difference between an ICD and pacemaker on a scan as it is important to be able to determine which piece of equipment they have before treatment or further tests. During one of the patient visits, we were able to observe a different type of translator. During Week Two of this program, we saw that the physician called a translator and the patient spoke to him on the phone. This week, an &#8220;In-Demand Interpreter&#8221; system where a translator was video-called was used. This system took a few minutes to get and setup, but the video and sound quality was very good. The patients seemed very comfortable as they were able to see the translator. Overall the conversation flowed much better than the phone conversation that we witnessed a few weeks ago. The aspect of the conversation that seemed a bit confusing for both the physician and patient was the medication review. It was hard for the patient to understand the medication names. So, the Pharmacy students were given the task of reviewing the medications with the patients after the Fellow visit (this is normally the case).    </p>
<p>Similar to previous weeks, scheduling and appointment/procedure times seemed to be difficult to predict. While reviewing consultation times, a Fellow noticed that a patient who would require a translator was only scheduled for a 20 minute slot. However, patients requiring a translator should be given a 40 minute slot. The Fellow then requested that the appointment be updated to reflect the time required. I thought it was very helpful that the appointment durations could be selected to reflect the need of the patient. Also, the procedures (such as bronchoscopies) often run later than scheduled due to factors often outside of the physician&#8217;s control (patient arrival time, preparation time, etc).</p>
<p>I look forward to the rest of the week.</p>

In the Outpatient Care Clinic, I noticed that the hallway had lots of natural light and the hallways were very wide. There is also seating available in the hallway in addition to the seats in each of the clinic rooms. The clinic room that we visit each week is located in 3C (the Pulmonary and Allergy Clinics are held here). Along the hallway there are multiple clinic rooms/offices and are labeled 3A &#8211; 3F. Overall, I noticed that the building was very well organized.</p>
<p>We spoke with one of the Fellows about the topics that we have identified as potential areas for improvement. On the topic of MICU delirium, the physician mentioned that in terms of treatment, he believes that most people should know not to treat patients with benzodiazepines. He also thought that our idea to have family pictures in the patient&#8217;s room (to make them feel more comfortable) would benefit the patients. He also suggested we look into the impact of calming music on patient health. When we discussed regulating the sleep/wake cycle for the patients, the physician mentioned that lights are generally turned off at 7 or 8 PM and they are not so good at turning them back on during the day. To prevent noise disruption for the patients, we discussed with the Fellow about the possibility of providing the patients with ear plugs. He thought that this was a good idea, but cautioned that they would need to be visible to the physicians to prevent any confusion about the patient&#8217;s responsiveness.  </p>
<p>With respect to the need for better patient inhaler compliance, the Fellow mentioned that one of the pharmacists in clinic demonstrates proper inhaler technique to patients. However, the pharmacist is only in clinic on Friday, so not all the patients are able to benefit from their demonstrations. The Fellow mentions that he plays YouTube videos for his patients  about proper inhaler technique in their exam rooms while they wait, but he is not sure if other physicians do this. He thought a box to store inhalers would be beneficial (similar to daily pill boxes) and also thought our idea about labeling Controller and Rescue inhalers with a &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;R&#8221;, respectively, would be very helpful to prevent confusion. We also met with our mentor, who had a positive response to our ideas. He also mentioned that education was important in terms of letting patients and physicians know about the inhalers and delirium issues.</p>
<p>We were able to watch a procedure where an Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) was used to identify lymph nodes for biopsy. This patient had previously had a biopsy done on a tumor in one of his lungs, but it only brought up dead cells. Therefore, the lymph nodes were being targeted this time to try to get a better biopsy. I noticed the ultrasound monitor was placed behind the physicians which seemed a little inconvenient (they needed to turn their heads while holding the scope).  </p>
<p>I look forward to the next week and further developing our ideas.</p>

It was really exciting to see that our weeks of observations have allowed us to identify potential improvement that we could begin to address. Our team initially identified four areas of need related to MICU delirium, patient inhaler usage, physician time with patients, and physician visibility during pulmonary procedures. Although these are all extremely interesting topics, we felt that it would be the most feasible to focus on two topics instead of attempting to address all four of the identified needs. Therefore, our group decided to focus on patient delirium in the MICU and patient inhaler usage. In terms of patient delirium, we would like to find a way to decrease/prevent delirium in order to positively impact the patient&#8217;s recovery. For the inhaler use, we would like to educate patients on the proper way to use their medications to allow them to receive the most benefit from their treatments.</p>
<p>The first clinic that we visited this week was pretty busy. There were three Fellows, a Nurse Practitioner and an Attending seeing patients. The majority of patients that I observed had a history of smoking and were visiting the clinic due to issues such as shortness of breath, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome, and asthma. One of the first patient for the day was a first time patient and the physician needed to ask a series of background questions to establish a record for the patient. I noticed that she explained why she was asking each question and how it related to the patient&#8217;s care. The physician later explained to me that she did this to make the patient feel comfortable. She said that when asked personal  questions, some patients feel that the physician is judging them for their choices and she wants them to know that these questions are necessary and that she makes no judgment and wants to help them. A few of the patients required oxygen tanks, but did not bring them to the office and admitted that they do not like carrying around the tank. the large rolling tanks seemed to cause more inconvenience, but the smaller tanks need to be refilled more often, which is also a source of inconvenience. A patient who were still smoking were made aware of the Smoking Cessation Clinic and offered help to quit. the physicians tried to convince them to stop smoking as it would greatly help in preventing further damage to their lungs. The patient seemed interested in the clinic, but wanted to try to quit by himself before coming back to seek their professional help.</p>
<p>In the MICU, we focused on looking further into the environment and noise levels. The first thing we noticed was the doors to the MICU were wide open. We entered an empty patient room and tried to determine what the patients would hear from the outside. When the door was closed, the noises from the hallway were significantly muffled. In the hallway in front of two empty rooms, we tested how far noise could travel by having one part of our group discuss in a normal tone of voice and the other part of our group walk in the opposite direction and they reported that they could move 15 &#8211; 20 feet away and still be able to hear us vaguely. This indicated that patients in the MICU who have their doors open during rounds would most likely be able to clearly hear the physicians and nurses discussing in the hallway. I also noticed that one side of the MICU floor had sliding glass doors while the other had regular wooden doors. The glass door rooms allowed light from the hallway to enter the rooms and had curtains that surrounded the patient bed for privacy. The curtains were not open around most of the patient beds and the doors were kept open in the majority of the rooms. I wonder if there is a reason that the curtains are kept just around the bed and not just in front of the door (seems like it may be easier if curtains were placed in front of the door).  The majority of the rooms seemed to have their lights off. It was interesting to see that there were new observations that we were able to make about the MICU environment once we focused in on one particular topic in that area.</p>
<p>I look forward to the rest of the week!</p>

The patients that needed to go through this procedure prior to their visit said that it was extremely painful. One of the patients also said that she had pain in her arm for a couple of weeks after it was done and felt that a few of her fingers were numb for that time as well. This was the first time in the clinic that I had heard patients complain about the pain associated with the test. While discussing with the nurse, we learned that anesthesia is not used for this procedure and patients can experience pain/discomfort.</p>
<p>During one of the appointments, the physician reliance on technology was clear. The patient in the room needed to discuss her recent test results with the physician, however while the physician tried to pull up the records on the computer, the machine turned off. The physician tried to fix the computer but was unable to turn it back on. As a result, he had to go find an empty exam room and move the patient there to complete the conversation. This made me wonder what would happen in the event that a backup computer in another room was not available and felt the need of a contingency plan in case all rooms were occupied. Once the computer dilemma was quickly resolved, the nurse came to demonstrate how to use an inhaler system for Tyvaso (prostacyclin). The nurse explained how to assemble the system and how often to administer the medication. </p>
<p>During our second visit to the MICU for the week, we listened to a presentation given by one of the Fellows about &#8220;Surviving Sepsis Guidelines&#8221;. We also talked to an anesthesiologist about her work and what she has seen with patients suffering from delirium during her time in the MICU. Similar to our conversation with the other residents, she mentioned that benzodiazepines could negatively impact the cognitive function of the elderly in particular. She also said that getting the patients out of the ICU, bringing family, regulating the sleep/wake cycle and re-orientation of the patient would help decrease the delirium.</p>
<p>The last stop on Friday was at a clinic where we were able to follow the Attending and Fellows for their patient visits. The physicians were extremely welcoming and explained each patient&#8217;s condition and scans with us. On the topic of ICU delirium, the Attending told us that when he was an intern forty years ago that the lights would be turned off and the nurses were very serious about making sure everyone was quiet and keeping doors closed so that the patients could rest.</p>
<p>This was an eventful week where we learned quite a bit from our rotation and look forward to the next week.</p>

It was interesting to hear about the patterns and issues that they were all observing. Everyone seemed to have a great time observing the surgeries and learning about devices that were being used. Afterwards, we learned about the components of a need statement and reviewed examples of underdeveloped and revised statements. Lastly, we went back to our observation boards, added more notes from the week, organized our post-its by category and wrote a few need statements for Pulmonary and Critical Care.</p>
<p>During our time in the MICU, we focused on asking the residents about ICU delirium. They stated that ICU delirium can occur in patients when they have been in the hospital for an extended period of time and seems to occur more frequently in elderly patients. The delirium can change on an hourly basis and patients can become especially confused during nighttime. To help prevent delirium, the residents mentioned that it would be beneficial if a good sleep/wake cycle could be maintained (such as by keeping blinds open during the day and closed at night) and patients feel as comfortable as possible (for example, sometimes it is helpful if the patient&#8217;s family would bring pictures from home). In the ICU, regulating the sleep/wake cycle is difficult because patients need to be woken up for testing early in the morning to have results for rounds at 8 AM. In addition, the IV poles beeping sound and bed alarms can wake patients up or prevent them from being able to fall asleep. One of the residents made it very clear that benzodiazepines were not good treatment options for delirium. She said that many professionals still used benzodiazepines because they were not well educated on the patient delirium issue and are unfamiliar with the treatment. When patients, especially the elderly, are treated with benzodiazepines they have a higher risk of falling. One of the other residents mentioned that another hospital that he had worked at had signs such as &#8220;Call, Don&#8217;t Fall&#8221; in the rooms and above the patient beds to remind confused patients that they need to ask for help before trying to go anywhere.</p>
<p>During our time in the Pulmonary Fellows Clinic, we went to see patients with both the Nurse Practitioner and Attending Physician. The issues that were addressed in the clinic included possible sleep apnea, problems related to COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), and sarcoidosis. For the patient with the suspected sleep apnea, the Nurse Practitioner mentioned that the patient would have to undergo a sleep study, but that it would have to be scheduled in two months because the clinic appointments are booked until then. It seemed that this could be related to the fact that the clinic only has nine rooms for the sleep studies that happen each night. One of the other discussions that appeared to be fairly common was the patient wondering which medications insurance would cover. In one of the cases, the inhaler that one of the patients had been taking (that had been benefitting them) had a significant price increase and he could no longer afford to purchase that brand. The physician and nurse told him that they would see what they could do in terms of getting the same medication or maybe seeing if there was another type that they could give him. Needing to check which of the inhalers or other medications were covered by patient insurance seemed to be a consistent part of the routine for the pharmacists and physicians.</p>
<p>We also had the opportunity to listen to one of the Fellows explain symptoms of Pulmonary Hypertension in more detail. To diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension, a right-heart catheterization needs to be done and the mean pulmonary artery pressure would greater than 25. Other tests to be done are: cardiac output,  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance. We then learned about the five pulmonary hypertension groups and the risks and test results associated with the conditions. The Fellow later explained that it is important to diagnose Group IV because it is treatable and can be cured. It can be treated through a procedure called a Pulmonary Endarterectomy or a vasodilator (for those unable to undergo the procedure). Group I (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) was also further explained to be associated with drugs, HIV, congenital disorders, collagen vascular disease (such as scleroderma), and cirrhosis. It was also surprising to hear that  on the west coast, the most common drugs to cause pulmonary arterial hypertension are weight loss drugs. In terms of the pathophysiology of  Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, the Fellow explained the associated causes are nitric oxide deficiency, increased endothelin and prostacyclin reduction. The issue with the drugs being used to treat these conditions have not shown to improve mortality. Also, trying to conduct a large study for Pulmonary Hypertension is difficult because it is a rare disease.</p>

Each patient visit consisted of a visit from the Pharmacist, Fellow, and both the Attending and Fellow. When talking with the Pharmacist, we learned that she goes to talk about the medications with the patients and tries to make sure that they know how to take them correctly. She follows a template so that she is able to maintain ten minute visits with each patient. When looking up patient information/records, the Pharmacist mentioned that it is much easier if they get all of their care at UIC (as records are easily available). The last patient of the day required a translator and the Fellow used the phone located in the exam room to call an interpreter. The interpreter translated for both the patient and physician and was heard via speaker. Overall the call worked, but I noticed that it was a little bit difficult to clearly hear what the interpreter was saying because of background noise coming from his office.  </p>
<p>On Friday, our first stop was at the MICU. During rounds, the Residents, Interns, Nurses, Fellows, Attending and Pharmacists discussed the patient care plans for each patient. The Clinical Pharmacist made an announcement to the group about a new Nanosphere DNA Detection device in the Microlab that could be used for testing patients. We also observed the ventilator system and an ultrasound being conducted on a patient. The ventilator is an important part in Pulmonary Care and uses positive pressure for treatment (as opposed to the negative pressure the body uses for breathing).Within a few days, the ventilator system can cause issues for the patient.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went to the Sleep Clinic. We were given the task of obtaining background information about the patients, their reason for the visit and completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale form with them. We asked patients about their sleep schedules, snoring, breathing, etc. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a form with a series of scenarios that the patient ranks from zero (would never fall asleep) to three (high chance of falling asleep). The total score helps the physician evaluate their tiredness. After gathering the information, we reported our notes to the Fellow, who then went to see the patient for their exam. It seemed that the patients liked talking to us. This was a great experience and I enjoyed being to talk to patients and listen to the physician use the information to find a plan to help them.</p>

It was a great opportunity to learn about their experiences in different environments. Later in the day, we completed an interview activity where we asked a partner to describe their perfect day. The last task on Monday was to use post-it notes to write down our observations and put them on a large white foam board. My group divided our notes into two categories, observations and suggestions, and divided the board into sections based on the various clinics and floors we have visited. I know this method will be extremely useful to maintain our notes in a more visual way.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">On Tuesday morning, we visited the MICU. I could immediately tell that the group going through rounds was smaller than the group we had seen last week (it seemed like only Team 2 was doing rounds with the Attending Physician this morning). This allowed the group to move more quickly from room to room. All of the team members were once again taking notes on their patient sheets. This practice caused me to wonder if using technology such as iPads or tablets would make referencing patient sheets and note-taking easier. Some of the rooms being entered were &#8220;Contact Plus&#8221; rooms and I noticed that each of these rooms had a chest with gowns, gloves, masks and disinfectant wipes. The individuals entering these rooms would discard these items in the trash inside the room. Also, there were stethoscopes hanging above the beds in these rooms for physicians to use. I noticed that those entering the patient rooms carried a blue mask with them from room to room(some had it wrapped around their elbow). After rounds, we looked at the scans on the big monitor in the room where Team 2 sits. While talking to the Attending Physician and the Pharmacist, we learned that a new system that connects the electronic medical record to the infusion pumps will eventually be introduced to the MICU. The system will allow infusion pumps to control dosages automatically based on values changed in the record. This will help prevent medication mix-ups and human error in dose control. The Attending Physician also made an interesting prediction, stating that with the way that ultrasounds are used to get information, the stethoscope may eventually be replaced with hand-held ultrasounds. The last procedure we observed was a Diagnostic Thoracentesis where fluid was being drained from around the lung. An initial ultrasound was important to complete to get a good visual on the area so that the resident and fellow could avoid hitting an artery. The needle being used for the procedure  was blunt to avoid puncturing the lung.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">The second half of Tuesday was spent in the Pulmonary Fellows Clinic. The first patient we visited mentioned that her oxygen tank was inconvenient for her to carry. Unlike the oxygen tank that could be rolled around, the patient had to carry the smaller tank in a side bag. The patient also mentioned that the oxygen tubes got tangled fairly easily. Overall, it seemed that inhaler discussions were the most common in the clinic. A major issue that the Nurse Practitioner told us about was that many of the patients mixed up their inhalers (they would exchange the controller and rescue). In addition, she mentioned that it was important for patients to understand that they need to take care of their heath consistently. I noticed that a lot of documentation was involved in the patient care process (seemed that just as much time was required for documentation as for the patient visit), and the physician mentioned that these requirements were being increased. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px">On Wednesday, our time was split between the Pulmonary Function Testing Lab and observing procedures. We visited the other PFT Lab and it was smaller than the other PFT lab room. There were fewer piece of equipment, so there was enough room for the technician, patient and our group. The technician was running the same tests that were done last week (spirometry, diffusion capacity, body plethysmography, etc.). In this room, instead of using two different machines for the testing, only one was used (door for the Masterscreen Body Device was left open for first part and closed for the second part). The technician explained the tests as he did them and also stated that he has to adjust the ambient conditions for calculations and calibrate the machine every morning. This device is older than the one in the other room and does not have a sample tubing component. In the afternoon, we observed a bronchoscopy (BAL) where the physicians wanted to check a small nodule in the lungs. The tip of the scope for this procedure was able to move up and down with a button, but the doctor needed to physically turn the device if they wanted to move it left or right. The scope itself had a lens and another part that could take in and shoot out liquids (such as saline or numbing medication). The physician and technician mentioned that one of the other scopes, the EBUS bronchoscope (utilizes ultrasound), was leaking. As the department only has one EBUS scope, all the procedures using the device needed to be rescheduled. </p>

On Thursday (June 1, 2017), we went to visit the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic. Initially, the team and I sat in a room where the Attending Physician (Dr. Machado) and fellows discussed patient symptoms and care plans. There were computers in the room for accessing patient information and monitors for viewing images. We were shown a patient&#8217;s CAT Scan of lungs (images showed heavy scarring) and then accompanied Dr.  Machado when he went to check the patient. During the visit, we learned about a technique that is used to test for pulmonary hypertension called cardiac catheterization. It measures pressure in the lungs and can lead to a diagnosis of the condition. In addition, we learned that pulmonary rehab is an option for patients to strengthen their lungs. The physician mentioned that cardiac catheterization is preferred for diagnosis purposes because echocardiograms can be incorrect when determining the pressure levels in the lungs. Next, we went to visit another patient who had completed a six minute walk test earlier. The physician pulled up the patient&#8217;s previous records on his computer and compared with the most recent results for discussions. The third patient that we visited suffered from a rare condition called scleroderma and also suffered from pulmonary hypertension. It was explained to us that scleroderma causes hardening of the skin (texture becomes leathery) and arteries. Having both scleroderma and pulmonary hypertension is very rare. We went on to observe the visits of two more patients and observed the checking of their pumps and inhaler discussions.</p>
<p>During all of the patient check-ups, I noticed that the physicians were using the computer in the room (every room had a computer) to look up patient history. The patients were asked to sit on beds while getting their breathing checked. During one of the visits, the foot pedal was pressed to control bed position (move the top part forward), but the pedal/bed was not working. So, the physician asked him to raise his legs for observation.  </p>
<p>For the second part of the day, we went to the PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) Lab. The technician was using various machines to test the impact of a patient&#8217;s asthma medication. The software automatically converted the units of the measurements (example: inches to centimeters). The first machine was to conduct a spirometry test (patient breathed in and out in the machine) and the software was capable of allowing &#8220;good&#8221; data from various tests to be attached with the best version of final data. As a result, the technician did not need to conduct tests over and over to get a good overall data set. The second test, the &#8220;diffusing capacity test&#8221; determined the patient&#8217;s lung efficiency. The American Thoracic Society has guidleine for what is considered an acceptable result for this test. A small level of carbon monoxide is used in this test, so the technician had the patient wait two minutes before conducting the next test. In the third test &#8220;body plethysmography&#8221;, the patient sat on a glass box-type machine and the test run was pressure based. For this machine, the technician mentioned that it would be convenient if the microphone that she used would turn on when she was using the screen (currently she has to turn on the microphone manually). After all the tests ran the first time, the patient used his inhaler and two of the tests were repeated to determine if there was any improvement. At the end of the visit, a printout of all the results were provided to the patient.</p>
<p>The technician said that 10 &#8211; 14 patients visit the PFT lab on average per day. She stated that the changes in the health care system has led to a decrease in the number of patients coming in for testing. We looked at the mouthpiece used by the patients for the machines and it was explained to us that the piece had a built-in filter for sanitary purposes. In addition, the first machine had a rapid gas analyzer. In terms of the software, the technician mentioned that the equipment was based on Microsoft, so it was easier to learn about and train others about the new devices. Before our time at the PFT Lab ended for the day, the technician told us that a pre-registration system for patient check-ins would make the process much more efficient and less stressful for everyone.</p>
<p>On Friday (June 2), our time was split between the MICU and the Sleep Clinic. In the MICU, we observed the morning rounds. A large group of interns, nurses, and fellows (at least 10 people) gathered in front of the patient room and Dr. Machado listened to the patient details and care plans that were being summarized. A nurse wheeled around a computer and Dr. Machado used a small table to write his notes on. I noticed that those listening to the discussion in front of the patient rooms frequently took notes (everyone was provided a printout of the patient information based on data from 6:30 AM). We went around the floor and the time spent on each patient seemed to vary based on the severity of each case. After discussion, Dr. Machado and a few others would go into the rooms to say hello to the patient. Each patient room had a window, TV and glass doors. Two monitors were placed on the wall for both sides of the floor and had all of the patient heart rate information displayed. The nurses&#8217; station was located in the middle of the floor and the patient rooms were around it. A large screen behind the nurse station had the patient contact status listed (contact, non-contact, etc.) It was a little difficult at first to differentiate the nurses and interns because they were all dressed similarly. After visiting the patient rooms, the entire group went to a room to view the scans of patients on a big monitor. It seemed like they were unable to watch the Echo video because the computer did not have the required software installed. It appeared that the patients were assigned to one of two teams and kept track of that way (in terms of deciding whether they leave or stay in the MICU). Overall, the MICU was fairly noisy and I could hear the phones at the nurses&#8217; station ringing at almost all times. In addition, there were always discussions happening during rounds and various alarms and beeping sounds coming from the rooms.  </p>
<p>The Sleep Clinic was a very different environment from the MICU. The office and rooms were very quiet compared to the MICU, and there was much less traffic in the hallways. The clinic runs nine rooms at a time and the exam rooms are used as sleep study rooms at night. Each room has a TV, bed, computer, bathroom and equipment for monitoring the patients. For testing, the EEG, EKG, and EMG wires are connected to a headbox which is connected to a base station.Two patients are assigned to each technician. We met with Dr. Najjar and he mentioned that the Electronic Medical Record was not very good and that there was a lot of room for improvement. For example, it was slightly inconvenient when Dr. Najjar was looking at his schedule, he needed to manually extend the columns to view his whole schedule. Our group of four was split in half and each group went with a fellow. There seemed to be a consistent routine where the fellows would meet with a patient, record new information on the computer in each exam room, then the fellow would meet with Dr. Najjar to discuss the plan.  Then the doctor would go to have a conversation with the patient.   I thought it was amazing how the  sleep studies provided data that helped the physicians accurately diagnose issues like sleep apnea and narcolepsy.</p>
<p>This week was filled with new experiences and I am excited for next week!</p>

On the first day, I met the other members of my group (for the Pulmonary Critical Care rotation) and we were all introduced to the specific details regarding the program. We also went through a presentation discussing user-centered medical device designs. This was defined as being &#8220;an approach that brings the user&#8217;s needs into consideration at every stage of the design process of the project&#8221;. We also discussed how user-centered design and medical device development were different and that a good user experience could be reached at the intersection of technology, business, and human values. In order to better understand the design approach, we reviewed a case study about infusion pumps and answered the following questions in teams: &#8220;What is the systematic problem that needs to be addressed?&#8221;, &#8220;Who are the users?&#8221;, &#8220;What are the shortcomings of the existing design?&#8221;, and &#8220;How will the device be used?&#8221;. After lunch we went through fun exercises to bond as a group and discussed the aspects of the program that we were excited for and the parts that we were nervous about.</p>
<p>On the second day of the program, my team and I started our first day of our Pulmonary Critical Care rotation. We met with our mentor and he explained our schedule for each week. He explained that we would be observing procedures, visit the Pulmonary Function Lab, the ICU, the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic and the Sleep Center Clinic. After the introduction to our rotation, we went to observe a Transbronchial Biopsy and a Bronchoscopic Alveolar Lavage (BAL). When I walked into the room, I noticed that it was well lit, but also that it was smaller than I thought it would be. The technician called our attention to the portable X- Ray machine (C- Arm) and the machine to which the bronchoscope would be attached. The technician also mentioned that they did not really use fiber optic scopes anymore (they would break easily) and that the digital scopes that they currently used had better images. While explaining the transbronchial procedure, he stated that a risk was lung collapse (if too much sample is pinched off). The BAL was described to be a safer procedure where saline is used to collect samples of interest (the scope is pushed as far as it will go until it wedges and the saline is sent to region and collected again for testing). Prior to the procedures the patients were given anesthetics to prevent pain and gagging. During the procedures the room was pretty crowded. I noticed that there were a lot of wires behind the machines that needed to be plugged in. Also, the bed that the patient was on (specifically used to be able to use C-Arm) had a remote control that had so many buttons on it that the technician had a slightly difficult time determining what the front and back ends were (the bed was positioned and repositioned ). All of the individuals in the room were required to wear lead vests(available in the hall way on a rack). Three ceiling lights (above patient) were kept on during the procedure. I also noticed the patient coughed quite a lot and the technician said this could make the procedure slightly more dangerous. Afterwards the scope was rinsed off and would be sent for further cleaning.</p>
<p>Next, we went to the ICU. After speaking to a few of the interns, we were made aware of a few issues/concerns that we could possibly address: there is no place to put ultrasound devices (currently in hallway), the device alarms interrupt patient sleep cycles (they wondered if alarms could be on a pager system?), patients have to be woken up early (4 AM) to get blood drawn and other tests completed in order to have results for rounds at 8 AM, having two monitors to work on would increase efficiency, it would be helpful if scheduled consult notifications could be sent/paged directly to  physicians. After this discussion we went to observe a tracheotomy. The room was again pretty crowded (6 people in the room &#8211; not including our group). I could hear various alarms going off, but the surgeons, technician and nurses did not seem to be distracted by them at all. I noticed that the patient had a bandage on her head with the date written on it. A surgeon mentioned that in literature, this is said to be a 4 minute procedure, however in reality we could see that it was taking longer. A camera was used to make sure the first needle was inserted in the proper place and this seemed to be tricky. However, after the initial needle insertion, the rest of the procedure seemed to move along smoothly.</p>
<p>This was a great first few days and I can&#8217;t wait to the rest of the Pulmonary Critical Care areas!   </p>

My name is Najah Ahsan and I am a rising Senior in the Bioengineering Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago with a concentration in Cell and Tissue Engineering. As a Bioengineer, I am committed to apply my knowledge and experience in developing products that can improve the quality of life of people. It is imperative that engineers not only be able to design products efficiently, but also understand how each product functions in the environment for which it has been developed. Therefore, it is very important to understand the needs of physicians, patients and others involved in the treatment process for successful implementation of a medical device. The Clinical Immersion Program is an unique opportunity to observe clinical environment, participate in discussions with physicians, patients and other caregivers, and observe surgical procedures. The hands-on experience involving examination, diagnosis, and treatment provide insight about the needs of physicians and patients, and the participants gain invaluable knowledge about concerns that encourage them to start thinking about potential solutions. Please feel free to send me an email if you have any questions about my blog. Thank you!</p>
