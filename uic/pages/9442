<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) data management systems combine traditional schema-based integration techniques with the P2P infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a P2P data management framework named PEPSINT that semantically integrates heterogeneous XML and RDF data sources, using a hybrid architecture and a global-as-view approach. Our focus is on the query processing techniques over heterogeneous data. Queries in PEPSINT are expressed in XQuery and in RDQL. We consider two types of queries, depending on whether the query is first posed on the super peer or on one of the peers. </p>
