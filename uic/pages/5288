<p>Everyone has a different view of the city we live in: some people think of the iconic skyline, some think of politics and corruption, and some think of that smell on the CTA.The new CNN miniseries Chicagoland seeks to investigate several complex facets—from the mayor’s office to gang violence to community activism and advocacy—of one of America’s biggest cities.</p>
<p>Students from the Honors College were able to attend an invitation-only advance screening for the first episode of this new series at the Bank of America Theater on March 4. Cristian Nuno, a sophomore double major in economics and urban and public affairs, was “amazed by the amount of local [leaders] in the theater. All around me there were local newscasters and journalists, surrounded by Chicago Police Department officers.” Nuno ended up seated next to Chief of Police Gary McCarthy.</p>
<p>The first episode showcased Rahm Emanuel’s efforts to improve the school systems in some of the Chicago neighborhoods most affected by violence. The show followed the actions of McCarthy, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and Principal Elizabeth Dozier of Fenger Academy High School during the time when fifty-three Chicago Public Schools were closed.</p>
<p>“It was refreshing to watch something that was [so] informational about our city,” junior economics major David Klein said about the screening. “CNN did a great job in presenting both sides of the story.” Nuno concurred, saying that “it was clear that the show was using Chicago as a platform to showcase the struggles that every American city is going through.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Chicagoland series has eight episodes, all presented with a documentary feel while exposing the relevant and emotional stories of this beautiful city. Keep an eye out for Honors College announcements for more opportunities and great experiences like this one.</p>

<p>For future doctors, the importance of healthy populations cannot be overstated; it is because of this that UIC’s Health Activism Committee (HAC) works towards creating a healthier Chicago. HAC is one of several committees that work within UIC’s Society of Future Physicians —an Honors College student organization that prepares members for the medical field. HAC consists of two programs that reach out to the local community: the Social Outreach Program (SOP) and the Health Education Program (HEP).</p>
<p>The Social Outreach Program (SOP), headed by sophomore biochemistry major Collin Langer, is in its first year. SOP hopes to create an online application that will help community college students make better choices regarding health care. The majority of last semester was devoted to getting members familiar with the Affordable Care Act and contacting local community colleges. “ We are currently setting up a focus group for Truman College and potentially Malcolm X College soon after. These focus groups are being used to see what community college students know, think, and want to know about the Affordable Care Act,” Langer explains. In addition to expanding within the local community, SOP also brought its project to the Clinton Global Initiative University Conference held from March 21 to March 23 in Arizona.</p>
<p>Also part of HAC is the Health Education Program (HEP). Led by junior biology and psychology major Chandni Patel, members educate local high school students on topics including nutrition, drugs, mental health, and sex education. The program was instituted in April 2011 and encourages members initiatives to create their own presentations on health education issues. In April, members of HEP presented their projects at Clemente High School.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Sophomore biology major and HEP member Maria Nakhasi describes the progress they have made: “We wanted to make the curriculum more engaging and the students have really responded well. We are very excited about the innovative improvements that have been made to the presentations.” Members of the Society of Future Physicians are encouraged to take part in one or both of these programs and help make an impact on their local communities.</p>

<p>Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle came to UIC on October 18th to talk to students about “Reform in Cook County Government” as part of the Future of Chicago Lecture Series co-sponsored by the Department of Political Science and the Honors College. The talk included a question-and-answer session and was followed by a luncheon in Burnham Hall.</p>
<p>During the lecture, Preckwinkle spoke to her past as a teacher and touched on her exposure to politics as a teenager, experiences she regarded as invaluable to her decision to run for office. Preckwinkle also outlined many of her key policy concerns and explained how the Cook County budget is spent. In the luncheon that followed, Honors College students had the opportunity to talk in-depth with Preckwinkle about her career, policies, and motivation. Throughout both the talk and luncheon, Preckwinkle engaged the students with her progressive policies and positions regarding immigration reform, business subsidies, urban planning, and healthcare. Senior Katherine Feekin, a student in the Urban and Public Affairs program, said of the event, “The opportunity to attend a small luncheon with [Preckwinkle] after the lecture was incredible. She is an inspiring woman, and I was so thankful to be able to meet her in a more personal setting. She spoke candidly about her life and her views, and it is not an experience I will soon forget.”</p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Optimized-IMG_8136.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-623" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Optimized-IMG_8136.jpg" alt="Optimized-IMG_8136" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>When asked about the biggest challenge for Chicago that Preckwinkle observes from her post on the Cook County Board, she replied, “Chicago is [seen as] a place of political corruption for a lot of people in Illinois [&#8230;] There’s that legacy that’s hard to overcome.” Additionally, Preckwinkle Toni Preckwinkle holds healthcare as a high priority, and 35% of the $3 billion county budget goes towards this area. Her other priorities include public safety and economic development. Last year Preckwinkle rolled back the sales tax increase implemented by her predecessor Todd Stroger, something she cited as a first in Cook County history. She has also worked for the past three years to reduce the numbers of pre-trial detainees sitting in jails. Chicago and Cook County have the largest unified court system in the United States, but case disposal is slow and jails become “an intersection of racism and poverty,” as she called it, due to questionable policing efforts that target specific areas and nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p>As the luncheon concluded, she urged students to “find a candidate you believe in. Get behind them and back them all the way.”</p>

		<p>While it is well known that Honors College students stay busy in the classroom, there are<br />
also many ways for them to broaden their horizons outside of their daily course schedules. The<br />
Honors College’s Chicago Signature Honors Programming offers students valuable opportunities<br />
to explore the rich variety of cultural and educational attractions in Chicago. Under the guidance<br />
of Post-Doctoral Fellows in Teaching and Mentoring Dr. Vernon Lindsay and Dr. Aleks<br />
Zarnitsyn, students can take advantage of discounted or free tickets provided by the Honors<br />
College to attend performances at the Lyric Opera, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the<br />
Steppenwolf Theatre Company, and other distinguished art sites across the city. Students may<br />
also explore cultural centers such as Chinatown or visit a variety of museums throughout the<br />
diverse urban environment.</p>
<p>Since the fall semester began, Chicago Signature Honors Programming has already<br />
hosted a number of excursions, including the Soviet film Nostalghia at the Gene Siskel Center,<br />
the Verdi’s opera Otello (based on the Shakespeare play Othello) at the Lyric Opera of Chicago,<br />
and the American drama This Is Our Youth at the Prop Theatre. Students are often given the<br />
opportunity to participate in group reflections or speak with the actors, directors, or artists behind<br />
the scenes, making the experience even more meaningful.<br />
One excursion, the trip to see the Broadway musical The Color Purple at the Mercury<br />
Theater Chicago, was particularly memorable for sophomore Monica Makar. “I don’t usually<br />
enjoy musicals at all, but that was truly phenomenal,” Makar proclaimed. “I was so impressed<br />
with how they translated such a difficult, serious novel into a moving show that made me want to<br />
both laugh and cry.”<br />
Chicago Signature Honors Programming has only just begun for the year, and upcoming<br />
outings include a trip to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as well as the Art Institute of Chicago.<br />
Students are encouraged to reserve their spots early online in order to participate in the vast<br />
amount of exciting events to come!<br />

<p>The spirit of innovation and creativity ignites a spark in thousands of people across the city of Chicago each year during Chicago Ideas Week (CIW). The annual conference transforms the city into a hub of intellectual activity as the best and brightest gather in Chicago to give presentations and share ideas. Among the 25,000 attendees at this year’s October 14-20 conference were several Honors College students who received tickets through the College from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR).</p>

<p>While many idea-based events are exclusive, Chicago Ideas Week is set apart because the events are intended for all members of the public. The mission of CIW is to provoke thought, create connections, and encourage people to achieve great things. The events take place in a variety of formats. Some are lectures with a series of speakers discussing aspects of a given field, while others are labs that give attendees a behind-the-scenes look at a particular industry. These events take place all over the city, including one at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory, where the “walls” are 3D TVs that allow total immersion in futuristic technology.</p>

<p>Throughout the week, participants could sample everything from glass-blowing workshops to discussions on the tumult in the Middle East to stories of successful entrepreneurs and authors. Attendees also could hear talks by people from a variety of backgrounds, including New York Times best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and MySpace founders Chris and Tim Vanderhook.</p>
<p>Honors College sophomores Hannah Lee and Erika Peters attended the “Explorers” lecture with tickets provided by the Honors College in collaboration with the OVCR. After listening to professional BASE jumpers, National Geographic photojournalists, and oceanic scientists, Lee and Peters felt their horizons had expanded. According to Lee, “The talk inspired me to travel more and push myself outside of my comfort zone.” “They really emphasized the fact that people are only limited by their perceived boundaries,” Peters added.</p>
<p>Sophomore Amy Halder attended the lecture “Music: Evolution of the Artist.” Like many CIW events, this lecture featured a variety of speakers from a single field. Together the speakers’ multiple perspectives provided a cohesive image of the music industry. For example, artist Rachel Yamagata spoke about the process of writing a song, songwriter Mike Posner contributed ideas about artistic collaboration, and Lollapalooza founder Marc Geiger spoke about how technology and social media have changed the music industry. Halder explained, “One of the artists mentioned that music is like catching a butterfly—you need to be gentle and caring. Posner followed that talk by saying that the job of a producer is to bottle that butterfly in a beautiful jar and present it to the audience.”</p>

<p>This holistic approach to the lectures is a defining feature of CIW, because individuals are more likely to be spurred into action by understanding multiple aspects of a certain topic or field. As future leaders, Honors College students are perfectly primed to create change in the world. The first step, however, is becoming passionate about an idea and deciding to do something about it: exactly what Chicago Ideas Week hopes to encourage.</p>
