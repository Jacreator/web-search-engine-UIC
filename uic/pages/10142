We wanted a device which would hold the left forearm in place to help the cardiologist gain radial access for a catheter procedure. We listed some high-level specifications, such as comfort, safety, and adaptability. This week we began thinking of valid designs. The first step was to take the problem and translate that into a number of features that we wanted our solution to provide. You can think of this as &#8220;how can we make the specifications more tangible?&#8221; For example, we wanted the solution to be comfortable so we were thinking of using a soft, cushiony material upon which the arm would be rested. We also thought about safety. We needed our device to be easy to clean and provide a sterile area where the doctor can perform the procedure to prevent infection. We came up with this rough list of features of an arm rest which would hold the left :</p>
<ul>
<li>A band which holds the palm and extends the wrist</li>
<li>Can be elevated enough for when the patient cannot lie flat, e.g. congestive heart failure patients who must sit up to some degree to be able to breathe</li>
<li>Use a ball and socket joint to allow freedom of movement in multiple planes</li>
<li>All moving parts must be easily lockable so that the surface is stable during the procedure but can be easily moved out of the way when necessary</li>
<li>The arm rest must be able to be easily positioned to accommodate a large range of patient sizes</li>
<li>The arm rest must be cushy</li>
<li>The arm rest must be cleanable and allow a sterile work area</li>
<li>The upper arm can be stabilized by a foam cushion or something similar (we won&#8217;t solve this problem directly; we can use existing low tech solutions to accommodate this to keep costs down and to provide simplicity)</li>
<li>Must be radiolucent to not interfere with fluoroscopy</li>
<li>Allow pronation of forearm</li>
<li>U-shape adjustable arm rest</li>
<li>Allow the patient to move the forearm closer to the doctor for easier access</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we came up with this list, we began to brainstorm about possible designs. We looked into technologies which existed which would prove that our designs had a basis in reality.  We looked into various rotating and sliding hinges, surfaces, and materials. We also experimented with various patient positions by using our own bodies as a reference while also imagining extremely large and small body sizes. We began to whittle away some of our designs as we found out what could and couldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>We also spent time interviewing doctors. We needed to validate that we were working on a problem that truly existed and that finding a solution would be meaningful and beneficial to both patients, doctors, and the healthcare system (i.e. ultimate reduces healthcare costs overall).</p>

Our first needs statement focused on the difficulty associated with inserting a transesophageal echo probe into patients. After many interviews and observations, we have changed our focus. We started to see that fixing the problem with TEE probe insertion was not straightforward. First, we&#8217;ve learned that the main factor which affects easy insertion is experience. It takes time for doctors to become competent and even more to become adept. Through our research, it became obvious that fixing this problem isn&#8217;t as easy as using a smaller probe. Small probes have been implicated in higher patient risk of esophageal rupture. Esophageal cameras have already been used as needed. Over the course one week, a new fellow said that she already started to understand how much pressure to use in order to successfully insert the probe.</p>
<p>While solving the TEE insertion problem would certainly be helpful, we decided to look into our other ideas instead. The need that we ultimately decided on was one which has a greater impact on doctors and patients.</p>
<p>Our new needs statement deals with helping doctors perform routine cardiac catheterization (cath) procedures more easily. During certain cath procedures, it can be common for the doctor to gain access to a patient&#8217;s arterial system either through the right femoral artery in the groin or through the left radial artery in the arm. There are pros and cons to deciding which site of access to use, but for simplicity&#8217;s sake, one can argue that catheterization through the femoral artery is &#8220;easier&#8221; (easier to reach for the doctors since they stand on the patient&#8217;s right side; the femoral artery is also the more traditional route of access). Cathertization through the left radial artery is better for the patient (quicker and less painful recovery) but many doctors opt not to go through the left arm because it is hard to reach over a patient to perform the procedure. This can be especially true with large, obese patients.</p>
<p>Our solution is in its beginning stages, but we envision a solution which allows doctors to more easily perform procedures through the left radial artery. Anecdotally we&#8217;ve heard first-hand that some doctors actively avoid the left arm catheterization unless absolutely necessary. While patient health may produce the same outcome either way, extensive research has shown that a patient&#8217;s recovery is significantly shorter and less painful when cath procedures are done through the radial artery.</p>
<p>The design specifications we identified are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort (patient immobile for long periods of time)</li>
<li>Safety (cannot cause infection or impede procedures)</li>
<li>Intuitive</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Feasible (cost effective, economic/health benefits)</li>
<li>Adaptable (can fit various beds)</li>
<li>Adjustable (different patient sizes)</li>
</ul>
<p>The design criteria we identified are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must:
<ul>
<li>Allow the cardiologist to gain easy catheter access via the left radial artery</li>
<li>Adjustable for different sized patients</li>
<li>Adjustable for different arm and hand positions based on the cardiologist’s needs</li>
<li>Allow for sterile procedures</li>
<li>Made out of radiotranslucent materials for x-ray</li>
<li>Be easy to control and set up</li>
<li>Be attachable to various hospital beds</li>
<li>Not get in the way of other equipment</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Below are my thoughts about the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve through our needs statement.</p>
<p>This week my group&#8217;s needs statement focused around the difficulties associated with inserting a transesophageal echo (TEE) probe down a patient&#8217;s throat, especially for inexperienced doctors. This was a problem that we&#8217;ve seen repeatedly througout our three weeks in cardiology. This gave us the opportunity to speak to a number of physicians about their opinions and experiences. We asked if they&#8217;ve ever tried smaller probes. One doc said that that was never considered as an option &#8212; when she learned how to do the procedure, she said that &#8220;everyone always just used the same size probe.&#8221; Two different doctors, one a fellow and another an attending, said that they rarely encounter problems. While still other doctors say that it&#8217;s always hard or that it takes a lot of experience before it gets easier. Although there&#8217;s a range of opinions on the matter, there seems to be enough information anecdotally and through online research that inserting TEE probes can be difficult; any complications associated with the procedure can, in the end, increase costs, waste time, and ultimately reduce patient safety and care. Primum non nocere.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In our storyboard we outline quite a few steps and pain points of a TEE procedure. We&#8217;ve seen the procedure done four different times, by four different sets of physicians, and in three different settings. The settings were in a cath lab, an EP lab, and at the bedside in the ICU. Although each case had some differences, we saw one common theme &#8212; there&#8217;s a significant amount of difficulty when inserting the TEE probe into the patient&#8217;s esophagus.</p>
<p>The very first patient procedure we saw was to be a TEE and a cardioversion in the cath lab. The probe was to be used to look for thrombi in the left atrial appendage of the heart. This is a common finding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). If a clot is not found, then it would be safe to cardiovert the patient using electrical defibrillation of the heart. If this would be attempted in the presense of a clot, then there is a good chance the thrombus would embolize, oftentimes to the brain and cause a stroke. However, in this instance, the probe was never able to be passed down into the patient&#8217;s esophagus. At first the fellow had tried under as the attending gave general directions, but when she started having trouble the attending started giving more and more specific suggestions. After about 15 minutes, the fellow could not pass the probe and the attending tried. Over the course of several more minutes, they tried different options. They tried the scope at different angles, they flexed the patient&#8217;s head forward, and they removed the bite guard and held the tongue out. None of these options worked. They were about to use a GlideScope which would help visualize the opening, but in the end they decided that the patient was a difficult case and did not want to risk harm by trying further.</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, we saw three more TEEs. In each case the fellow tried to insert the probe under the attending&#8217;s guidance. After some time the fellow was unsuccessful and the attending took over. In two of those cases the attending had a little bit of issue, but one time the attending was able to perform the TEE without any struggle. After speaking a bit with the fellows and attendings we found out that a doctor&#8217;s experience plays a large role in how easy it is to insert the probe. This is understandable since this is a mechanical procedure which requires a good amount of practice and skill. However, we see a great opportunity for improvement here. There must be ways to improve this procedure because if it takes years and many, many tries for doctors to hone their skills, then there is a large amount of risk to patient complications. We think by reducing this time by perhaps changing the size or design of the probe, or perhaps finding a way of training physicians by way of simulation, then maybe we could greatly reduce the amount of difficulty, quicken the time, and reduce the overall patient&#8217;s risk of complications during a TEE.</p>

<p>The first week in the Clinical Immersion Program was our entrance into cardiology. Although we spent a little bit of time getting oriented to the physicians, staff, labs, procedures, and equipment we pretty much jumped right in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Echo readings (bad design/process)</span></p>
<p>In the echo reading room, attending phy<a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5545.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  alignleft" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5545-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="153" height="153" /></a>sicians review incoming echo readings and record their findings for each patient. The amount of time it takes to read each patient&#8217;s case was variable, but one attending commented on how she generally reads about 6 cases per hour. Echo readings seem to be done throughout the day when the doctor can squeeze in the time. One day, the attending doing the readings was able to keep up with the incoming cases throughout the day and was able to juggle her other responsibilities fairly easily. However, we found that on another day a different attending was already pushing a 12-hour shift and had trouble keeping up with the number of cases to review and still had other duties to perform before she could go home. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to dive too much into why things were different for the two doctors, but it seems reasonable that these kinds of bottlenecks can occur based on how variable the workload is for a physician on any given day. Also, one of the doctors said that when she gets interrupted in the middle of a case, she has to start that case over again. Although I don&#8217;t have enough information to think of a solution for this, this could be an area for improvment that would be extremely beneficial. Once a person falls behind, it can cause a cascading effect which can spiral into bad outcomes for the physician, the team, and possibly patients. Although this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;bad device&#8221; per se, this is a pain point which should be addressed.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">EP lab (bad design/process)</span></p>
<p>The electrophysiology lab is a space where physicians and their staff can evaluate and repair defects in cardiac function as a result of abnormal electrical activity in the heart. We asked a nurse if she had any pain points and she mentioned that sometimes in between cases it is hard for different equipment to be set up because not all staff is trained properly. Different procedures require different equipment to be hooked up before each case. If only a few people know how to set up the equipment, then this can delay the procedures if those people are busy on other tasks. This can become a circular problem because as schedules get pushed back and the staff become rushed, then this doesn&#8217;t allow time for other people to be trained.</p>

<p>The cardiology outpatient clinic is a place <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5562.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  alignleft" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5562-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="178" /></a>where practitioners can examine patients who are in need of cardiac assist devices. We spoke to  a nurse who specializes in cardiac rhythm devices. This includes pace makers, implantable defibrillators, and others. We were allowed to observe her interactions with one patient who recently had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) surgically installed. The patient was prone to having arrhythmias (bad heart rhythms) and this device would monitor for those rhythms and shock the heart into a normal rhythm if necessary. Although the device in and of itself is a technical marvel, the way the practitioners can gather the device&#8217;s recorded information is equally facinating. First, because the device is implanted under the skin, the ICD must be able to communicate with other equipment wirelessly. When the patient was in the office, the nurse booted up a computer which paired with the patient&#8217;s ICD. Information stored on the ICD, such as the number of arrhythmias detected or shocks administered, were sent to the computer. This technology gives thorough and objective data which can be used to analyze the patient&#8217;s health. Without this type of monitoring, a patient at home may feel chest pain and tell the doctor about it in a subsequent visit, but there would be no way of telling if an actual arrhythmia and shock actually occured. Another good aspect of this device is its ability to pair with a smaller, more portable device which is kept at the patient&#8217;s home. It connects to the user&#8217;s home internet connection or it can connect to the internet through a cellular signal. Every night while the patient is asleep, the home device pairs with the patient&#8217;s ICD and downloads and transmits the recorded activity. Because this information is sent on a nightly basis, the nurse or doctor can monitor this information in the morning and can proactively contact the patient if they see an event has occurred.</p>
