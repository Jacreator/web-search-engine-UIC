<H3> Course description</h3>
This course is a blend of theory and practice. You will study some of the  
fundamental theoretical topics that are very useful in Computer Science.  
These include  
mathematical induction, set and function theory, run time analysis,  
combinatorics, and logic. You will also learn some basic data structures  
and algorithms, and do programming projects to strengthen your programming  
skills and to apply theory in practice. In addition, you will also study  
the basics of object-oriented programming using Java.

<li> Java Documents 
  <ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/"> API documentation</a>

  </ul>
<li>Set up Environment 
  <ul>
<li> Unix
  </ul>
  <p>J2SDK and JRE have been installed in cs server &quot;bert&quot;. 
  You can log on to &quot;bert.cs.uic.edu&quot;, directly use command &quot;javac&quot; 
  to compile and &quot;java&quot; to run the program. (As to command format, 
  refer to &quot;man javac&quot; and &quot;man java&quot;.) There are several 
  available editors for you to write code, such as &quot;pico&quot;, &quot;emacs&quot; 
  and vi.</p>
  <p>You also can download Java Development Environment and Running 
  Environment to your home PC.
  <ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">Windows</a>
  </ul>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <p><b>NOTE: (IMPORTANT!!!)</b></p>
  <p>In order to program and debug easily, you may use some Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools, such as <a href="http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_jbuilder.html"> Jbuilder</a>,
  <a href="http://www.bluej.org/"> Blue Jay</a>. For the programming assignments, you must make sure that your code can 
  be compiled and run in bert without any additional packages.</p>
  <p>Also you can develop and debug your code in Windows, but before you submit, 
  you should make sure that your code can run in &quot;bert&quot; because all 
  assignments will be graded on &quot;bert&quot;.</p>

<H3> Rules and Policies </H3> 
<uL>
<li> <b>Statute of limitations</b>: No grading questions or complaints, no
matter how justified, will be listened to one week after the item in
question has been returned. 
<li> <b>Cheating</b>: Cheating will not be tolerated. All work you
submitted must be entirely your own. Any suspicious similarities between
students's work (this includes homework, exams and program) will be
recorded and brought to the attention of the Dean. The MINIMUM penalty for
any student found cheating will be to receive a 0 for the item in
question, and dropping your final course grade one letter. The MAXIMUM
penalty will be expulsion from the University. 
<li> <b>MOSS</b>: Sharing code with your classmates is not acceptable!!!
All programs will be screened using the Moss (Measure of Software
Similarity.) system. 
<li> <b>Late assignments</b>: Late assignments will not, in general, be
accepted. They will never be accepted if the student has not made special
arrangements with me at least one day before the assignment is due. If a
late assignment is accepted it is subject to a reduction in score as a
late penalty. 
<li> <b>Classroom Conduct</b>: Classroom discussions and questions are a
valuable part of the learning process and are encouraged. However,
students who repeatedly talk among themselves disrupting the class lecture
will be asked to leave.
