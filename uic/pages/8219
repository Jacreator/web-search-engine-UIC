<p>This week we saw a complication that can possibly happen with a TIPS procedure and it spurred interest in a new type of stent that could be created. Sometimes, patients that receive TIPS procedures get too much blood shunted past the liver and it can cause major problems for the body. For example, a patient can have encephalopathy or experience right heart failure due to a TIPS. In order to combat these issues, the stent placed for a TIPS procedure has to be narrowed. One of the attendings explained to us several methods for narrowing the stent. After hearing all of the methods, it became clear that all of them are essentially &#8220;workarounds&#8221; in that there could be a simpler device created to serve their purpose. For example, one of the methods is opening a stent partially on both of its ends to wedge it within the original stent. This is difficult to do and can still slip out of the original stent. Another method involves deploying two stents, one small and one large. The small one pushes against the large stent narrowing its diameter. </p>
<p>A stent with a thick lining could serve this purpose in a simpler manner. It would be easier to deploy. Something that is important to consider is that whenever placing a stent within a stent there is a chance of it slipping past and dislodging from its original location. Therefore, the new stent design would need a method to grip the interior or sides of the stent so that this problem could be avoided. This is an interesting stent problem that would be valuable to look into. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">One of the most common procedures done in IR is paracentesis. This is the draining of a body cavity of built up fluid. Usually, this is done with a pigtail catheter. At the very start of our rotation our group had a discussion about some of the short comings of the process. We discussed the fact that the collection bottles are glass and can potentially be dropped and broken. They are also not as efficient in collecting fluid as possible and are sometimes difficult to discern when they are full. Furthermore, we saw that the bottles can lead to dripping of fluid and potentially spreading infectious substances at both the valves and the actual site where the hose connects to the patient. </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">It was exciting to see the innovation thoughts we had were shared by others as this week a device representative came to visit the office and discussed their new line of paracentesis devices. These devices were made of a new soft plastic material that could avoid the need to solidify the collected fluid as is usually done now for waste control measures. They also eliminate the fear that the bottles will shatter if dropped. Additionally, the bottles are pressurized to promote rapid fluid collection and even have an accordion plastic indicator that shows when the pressure is “used up” within the system and is no longer very effective. Finally, the valves on both ends of the tubing system were improved in this new model to prevent dripping. It was very rewarding to see that the experts in the field thought similarly about the shortcomings of the device as our group. It served as a good example that we are capable of coming up with powerful, useful solutions. </p>

<p>So far, I have described many devices used within the IR department, but have said little about the efficiency of the processes. One area that I find extremely cumbersome is what I will call &#8220;the process of the lead apron&#8221;. Lead aprons are necessary coverings that members of the clinical staff have to wear during most IR procedures. They help limit the amount of harmful radiation exposure that clinicians are exposed to. While their use is essential to the safety and health of everyone, there are many aspects of their use that may be reevaluated in order to improve efficiency and or health. </p>
<p>Some of the considerations include:</p>
<p>1. Lead aprons currently only cover the core are of a person&#8217;s body. There are head pieces available, but few members of the staff wear them. The portions of someone&#8217;s body that are uncovered are exposed to very harmful radiation and their exposure could potentially be minimized by better designed aprons or with more strict regulations on what is required of clinicians during procedures. </p>
<p>2. Lead aprons are extremely heavy and uncomfortable. Perhaps there are some designs that would better distribute the amount of weight that is concentrated on one area of a wearer&#8217;s body. There are already some variations available such as ones that only hang off someone&#8217;s shoulders versus ones that hang off the shoulders and the waist. </p>
<p>3. The process of putting on a lead apron is very tedious and slow. The aprons are all hung on two rods, which makes it difficult for more than one person to access their lead at a time. They are packed together and are on non-removable hangers. All of these things combined, slows down the already sluggish process of removing and putting on lead aprons. Usually these aprons have both velcro and buckles for both parts of the apron. It would be good to look into better mechanisms of closure of the aprons so that this part of the process could be sped up. </p>
<p>4. There seems to be a constant struggle of trying to find &#8220;your&#8221; lead. People have unique radiation sensors they clip on their lead that is later used to measure the amount of radiation exposure that a person has experienced. It is important to maintain safe levels in staff. Often, people swap lead and then do not swap out sensors, causing inaccurate sensor readings. By better labeling lead or having people be responsible for purchasing their own lead could save people from this safety hazard and from the constant struggle of finding the lead with their sensor. </p>
<p>Generally, clinicians make the best out of a frustrating process. I believe some improvements in both the design of the lead, the storage of the lead, and the processes around lead could improve safety and efficiency alike. </p>

<p class="p2">A dialysis fistula is a connection between an artery and a vein that is made surgically that improves the ability of a patient to receive dialysis. They can be made with a graft made of foreign material or they can be made with a patient’s own natural vessels. </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">An issue with all foreign object placement in blood vessels is that over time, the body attempts to remove this object. Since actual removal is impossible, the body tries to find a way to block this foreign object off. Typically, in the case of fistulas, this means that the vessel begins to clot off the area where the graft has been placed. To fix this issue, physicians have a variety of mechanisms to try to declot a fistula. One method to do this is performing an angioplasty. This is a procedure that uses a balloon to clear a vessel of debris. What I found particularly interesting was the differences in possible balloons that could be used for this procedure. There are compliant and noncompliant balloons that are inflated by a special device called an insufflator. This device is cumbersome to use and requires a significant amount of manual force by the user to actually inflate a balloon. Compliant balloons are similar to classic birthday balloons that can continuously increase in size as more air or pressure is added. Non-compliant balloons blow up to a certain size and remain at that size. Further addition of air merely increases the pressure of the balloon and makes it harder, but does not increase its size. The helps make sure a vessel is not over-stretched or burst. </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">The angioplasty procedure is currently sufficient to improving unclogging of vessels, but it is not ideal. Perhaps the balloon’s design could be improved to better clear blood vessels. Also, it is a consideration to think about other uses of the balloons. Maybe these balloons could be used to remove IVC filters. For example, by inflation of the balloon in the filter could help dislodge a filter and maybe could be wide enough to be used to pull the filter out of a vessel. </p>

<p class="p1">Similar to inferior vena caval filters, stents have gone through many generations of their design. Their placement is essential to maintaining a vessels functionality by keeping it open. A problem that typically occurs is that they can begin to stenose or close. When this happens, the patient is at risk for receiving less blood where they need to. This is a potentially dangerous situation. Speaking with some of the clinicians, they suggested a device that can electronically alert physicians when a stent is becoming occluded. This may mean that it can report a narrowing of the device or a change in flow. While change in flow may be an easier measure to detect, this is an indirect measurement of the actual problem that needs to be monitored. Flow rate is also altered frequently due to simple things such as a patient&#8217;s level of activity. Therefore, it would create many false readings. Due to these issues, finding a way to measure the narrowing of a stent would be preferential.  </p>
<p class="p1">Something worthy of consideration is the need to replace batteries if this sort of device was electronically operated. This problem could be potentially solved with piezoelectrically powered devices. Devices integrated with this are just coming on the market. For example, the new generations of pacemakers that are now available. </p>

<p class="p1">After having several opportunities to watch an IVC filter placement, our group has finally had the opportunity to learn more about the device and the procedure. Essentially, the device is placed in the inferior vena cava in the attempt to block blood clots from migrating from the periphery of the body to the heart. These clots are caught in the filter’s delicate design and are then naturally desolved by the body. The filter is typically kept in the body for some time and then is expected to be removed after a patient is no longer in a situation that they are in a high level threat for having blood clots. While this seems like an elegant solution that has greatly improved with time, there are still many major flaws with the design of the device. Some of these issues include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p> </p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">The device has hooks on its feet that help anchor it in the blood vessel and keep it upright. These sharp hooks can hurt the sides of the vena cava and make it difficult to remove the device. Actually, the hooks are so sharp that they can penetrate straight thorough the sides of the blood vessel, creating a potentially very serious situation for a patient.</li>
<li class="li1">The device is capable of migrating within the blood vessel far from its intended location. This too can be dangerous for the patient as the device is placed precisely for best clinical outcomes. This migration also leaves the blood vessel vulnerable to more likely injury by the sharp anchoring hooks. </li>
<li class="li1">The device shape has been changed and updated many times, but it is still not ideal. It does not catch all of the clots that clinicians would like it to. The trick in this is that it should not catch all clots, but only the ones large enough to cause serious issues for a patient. The design of the filter should also cause minimal change to the flow of blood past it, as this can affect efficacy of the heart. </li>
<li class="li1">The device can become clogged with clots and not let any blood through. The clogging is at such a fast rate the body can not break down the clots quickly enough. </li>
</ol>

When putting a chest port into a patient, a special port is placed under the skin that leads to the inferior vena cava. This provides the ability for physicians to administer drugs that can potentially harm small vessels straight to a large vessel in a less invasive way.<span class="m_-5569559690606789095Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="m_-5569559690606789095p1" style="color: #222222;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size: 12.8px"><span class="m_-5569559690606789095s1">What was most fascinating about this was the material which the port is made of. The septum technology that is palpated by a clinician is where drugs are later injected. It is specifically backed with a hard material so that the administrator does not pierce through to gentle organs below the chest port. The septum itself is made of a fascinating, highly resilient material that essentially reseals itself so that the integrity of the structure is not compromised over time as it is used. This is accomplished by using a special needle that is called a non-coring needle. Typical needles are coring, which means that the center is hollow and leaves a puncture hole in whatever material it pierces. The special non-coring needles have their holes on the side of their shaft so that they can still administer drugs, but do not leave a hole in the septum. This leaves the septum functional for hundreds of uses and decreases the likelihood of infection. This device is an amazing example of thoughtful design that takes into account the need for repetitive use and safety of the patient.<span class="m_-5569559690606789095Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="m_-5569559690606789095p2" style="color: #222222;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size: 12.8px"><span class="m_-5569559690606789095s1">After discussing the potential solutions for over-shunting blood to the heart after a successful TIPS procedure, Dr. Bui informed us that a new shunt has just come on the market! This shunt helps alleviate the previously described problem as it is a size 8 when it is placed. If the flow rate is deemed too little, it can be permanently stretched and locked into a size 10 by inflation of a balloon within it.<span class="m_-5569559690606789095Apple-converted-space"> </span></span> </p>
<p class="m_-5569559690606789095p1" style="color: #222222;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size: 12.8px"><span class="m_-5569559690606789095s1">While this is an exciting development as it confirms the issue that we discussed as being worthy of finding a solution, this new device does not fulfill all the necessary criteria. First, the change in size is permanent. There is no means to reduce the size once the shunt has been stretched to the larger 10 size. Moreover, the shunt only has two distinct sizes. A more valuable improvement would be a shunt that can be altered to be a variety of sizes. Additionally, this ideal shunt would be easily adjustable many times and would not be locked in a certain size once manipulated.<span class="m_-5569559690606789095Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="m_-5569559690606789095p2" style="color: #222222;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size: 12.8px"> <span class="m_-5569559690606789095s1">Another interesting aspect of the procedure we got to observe this time was the measuring of the necessary length of the stent. While the uncovered mesh portion of the stent is standard, the length of the covered portion is variable. This is determined by first placing a marking pigtail catheter that not only helps determined needed length for the shunt that is to be placed, but it also provides the ability to inject contrast. A similar device is a marked wire that has the disadvantage that it does not allow for one to inject contrast. These two devices are good examples of how a simple addition to a devices ability can revolutionize its purpose.<span class="m_-5569559690606789095Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p>One of the first large procedures we were able to observe was a TIPS placement. This procedure is used to treat portal hypertension. In order to avoid creating more strain on the liver, the TIPS procedure allows the blood of the body to bypass the liver. This is done by placing a shunt made of a mesh-like cage that provides stability to the structure, covered in a thin envelope that provides penetration of the blood into other unintended areas of the body.</p>
<p>The issue with this system is that it can sometimes cause too much blood to reach the heart. When this occurs, the heart is overwhelmed by the return input and can actually cause the body to go into cardiac failure.  To counteract this issue, a secondary and tertiary shunt can be placed within the original shunt in order to slow down blood flow to the heart. This essentially creates a &#8220;tube within a tube&#8221; effect that slows flow. Some issues that were presented with this &#8220;fix&#8221; is that it is complicated and takes many steps. It is also difficult to control how much flow is actually reduced by. It would be wonderful to figure out a way in which to do this in a simpler manner. For example, in gastric procedures, balloons can be placed and altered over time by inflation and deflation. This changes the amount of available space in the stomach. Similarly, this idea could be applied to the TIPS shunt to alter flow in a more precise way within an artery or a vein. Another potential approach would be to create a valve system that could be narrowed to alter the entry or exit of the shunt, essentially creating the same effect. I hope to explore this idea further in the weeks to come and discuss the potential solutions that may prove to be effective in solving this issue. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Procedure board</span></p>
<p>A central aspect of the IR environment is the procedure board. It is centrally located, creating a natural space for people to gravitate to. It is also essential to communicating to all staff members the overview of the current happenings of the department and what will happen over the next few hours. It contains an overwhelming amount of information from room numbers, to staff members names, to procedure details. </p>
<p>A glaring issue to me is that this board is still a simple white board with magnetic stickers placed on it that are updated by hand. Across from this board hangs an electronic version of this board that is linked to the hospitals electronic medical records (EMR). While this board is helpful, because of the information it provides and because it is automatically updated by the hospital&#8217;s EMR, it has limited flexibility. Essentially, this electronic board is not able to be fully customized in the way staff members are accustomed to. Dr. Bui insists that a new board would have to be able to be modified so simply that it could be done by the swipe of a hand. He describes something best summarized as a giant touchscreen. I believe updating the current electronic board to meet the customization needs of the department could improve patient safety and department efficiency. </p>

Our mentor, Dr. Bui, explained, &#8220;If an interventional</span><span style="font-size: 12.8px"> </span>radiologist is doing something exactly the same more than a few times, something is wrong&#8230; they should always be trying to evolve, to discover a faster way, or a way that makes patients have better outcomes&#8221;. This concept is inspirational because it provides evidence that it is not physicians stuck in their old ways that create limitations, but it is the technologies that they are provided with that limit their horizons. With this in mind, I have found new motivation to push myself to help provide physicians with a small improvement in their devices, in order so they can make great strides in patient care.<span class="m_-2348584918132189327Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="m_-2348584918132189327p1" style="color: #222222;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size: 12.8px"><span class="m_-2348584918132189327s1">The main concept behind IR is being able to complete a procedure in the most minimally invasive way possible. Usually, this means that procedures are completed through a tiny incision in which catheters, stents, and other small devices can be guided through. Guidance of these devices takes great skill as the only means of seeing their paths comes from imaging devices such as X-rays, MRI, ultrasound machines, and CT scans. This poses the first great limitation that IR currently faces: the issue of visibility. Currently, there is a trade-off between real-time imaging with low quality images, such as ultrasound, and high quality imaging, that can only provide static information, such as CT scans. Creating a device that can give the best of both imaging techniques, high visual quality with real-time ability, would revolutionize the field. It would make procedures faster, safer, and potentially could allow physicians to do tasks currently deemed impossible.<span class="m_-2348584918132189327Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

I look forward to the next couple weeks so that I can delve deeper into understanding both the workflows, devices, and processes of the many different procedures that occur in IR. </span></span></p>
