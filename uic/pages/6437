Over the past six weeks I had the privilege of joining Dr. Gonzalez at UIC and IBJI. During that time I worked hard to identify needs and think of innovative solutions to problems in orthopedics. When I entered this role, I did not have a firm foundation in orthopedic surgery. This made identifying problems difficult, as I did not have a good understanding of the work being done.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past six weeks I feel that I have gained a foothold of knowledge in orthopedic surgery. The generosity shown to me by the attending physicians, orthopedic residents, nurses, MAs, therapists, and medical students rotating through orthopedic surgery was instrumental in establishing this foundation. I am truly thankful for the patience and insight shared with me. Throughout my time I observed a great team culture within the orthopedic department. At the completion of this program I felt included in this team, and was delighted to be trusted with carrying out simple tasks to help.</p>
<p>I am also thankful for the guidance given by the clinical immersion program mentors as they ushered us through the steps of design and innovation. I hope to take what I learned from this experience, and apply it to become the innovative physician and problem solver I seek to be.</p>

Our time in the orthopedic surgery department has exposed us to many interesting applications, but we found that many of them might not be suitable for us to tackle during this clinical immersion program. The two most common reasons a possible project might be disqualified were:</p>
<p>1) We do not have a suitable background to understand the problem and suggest solutions. This was often the case in looking at surgical techniques and equipment. Quite a few surgeons and medical device companies are constantly working to improve surgical techniques and equipment.</p>
<p>2) The complexity of a proposed solution is beyond the scope of our course to be practical. This came up often when looking at workflow solutions that interacted with the electronic medical records system.</p>
<p>To find a project that we could both fully understand and tracks well with the goals of the clinical immersion program we looked at the physical and occupational therapy patients would receive before and after surgery. In therapy there were many creative and simple solutions. We felt that we might be able to best contribute in this space. To that end, we took a particular interest in gyroscopic devices used in occupational therapy to improve wrist strength and flexibility.</p>
<p>Most people agreed that the gyroscopes were cool and wanted to try them but often encountered difficulties in getting them started. The gyroscopes required winding and pulling a string very fast to get started as pictured above. This is a very difficult task for people who have MSK problems in their hands, wrists, or forearms. Over the next two weeks our goal will be to make the devices more intuitive to start and engaging for patients to use.</p>

To get started we were tasked with identifying specifications for the project we hoped to pursue. Before we could even begin with this task, we had to narrow down our project from the many potential projects we identified.</p>
<p>We settled on a project related to the physical and occupational therapy that is frequently prescribed to orthopedic surgery patients before and after surgery. The physicians we followed would often stress the importance of physical therapy to their patients, but also noted that adherence was frequently less than desired or the quality of therapy may be sub-optimal dependent on provider. To address these concerns we hope to deliver a solution with the criteria of improving patient adherence and outcomes in PT/OT.</p>
<p>We then identified four specifications for our design. We required that our design be<br /><span id="docs-internal-guid-140879b1-c3f8-f1c1-ed8b-a2247f0bf033" style="font-size: 27.999999999999996pt;font-family: 'Maven Pro';color: #424242;background-color: transparent;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline"></span></p>
<p>(1) Effective &#8211; In that implementation of our solution returns prior function</p>
<p>(2) Cost Efficient &#8211; So our solution can be widely adopted</p>
<p>(3) Intuitive &#8211; So that anyone could figure out how to use our solution quickly</p>
<p>(4) Fun &#8211; So that our solution would be used often</p>
<p>By keeping these criteria in mind we hope to deliver a solution that can be effectively used in the rehabilitation of orthopedic surgery patients.</p>

We undertook this task both in the clinic and in the OR.</p>
<p>We started in the clinic where we noticed some inefficiencies with analyzing and debriefing after problems occurred. The most glaring example was after a scheduled surgery was cancelled the day before. The cancellation frustrated the patient, their family, and the surgical team. Surgery was cancelled because the patient&#8217;s sodium level was not rechecked prior to surgery despite a note from the anesthesiologist requesting this be done before surgery proceeds.</p>
<p>In truth, sometimes problems like these are unavoidable. Surgeries get cancelled. Things don&#8217;t go as planned.</p>
<p>Where we identified a need, was in the aftermath of the cancellation. There is no system for analyzing failure modes, debriefing those involved, and moving on from the problem. Instead a huge amount of time was spent by one person trying to track down the source of the problem and mending fences between the different parts of the care team. This problem ended up delaying the start of clinic the next day and adding to patient wait times.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a need for a systematic debriefing after problems arise that focuses on preventing future problems and quickly resolving lingering questions.</p>
<p>In the OR we were able to observe some fascinating procedures. In one case a scaphoid fracture was repaired by using an autograft from the distal radius (as pictured above with a screw connecting the proximal and distal fragments of the scaphoid sandwiching the autograft). This technique is pretty new and replaces the old technique of harvesting an autograft from the patients ileus.</p>
<p>During the procedure, the majority of time was spent harvesting the autograft. Harvesting the autograft includes exposing the radius from the volar side and then molding the piece to be excised. The excision is done by using a small size high speed drill and then &#8220;connecting the dots&#8221; with a small straight osteotome.</p>
<p>The problem here is that the autograft is supposed to be an oval shape to conform to the short axis of the scaphoid and the osteotome is a flat plane. The need here is for a faster method of harvesting autografts from the distal radius to decrease operation time and risk of infection.</p>

The physicians were aware of a few they were quick to bring to our attention, but we also wanted to follow patients through their experience to see if we might be able to identify inefficiencies they may not have thought about.</p>
<p>Chiefly, the physicians were concerned with the repeated steps, and chances for error that may occur due to multiple people interviewing patients. We noted that when a patient first arrives at the clinic an MA will bring the patient back to the room and complete an intake form which collects information about allergies, chief complaints, and a pain score among other items.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right? The problem is that this information is not made available to the medical care team. Even if it were entered into the eMR, the information is not filed in clinical notes due to the way the software is set up. That&#8217;s not even the whole problem though. Since the MAs are so busy they don&#8217;t enter the intake forms until the end of the day because filling out the forms requires too much time navigating through different screens.</p>
<p>Over the next week we are going to work to address this issue by reaching out to Cerner to see if the software might be able to streamline the process and file these notes in the correct location.</p>
<p>In following patients through their appointments we were able to identify a few more inefficiencies. One illustrative example relates to the boy pictured above who came to clinic to have his cast removed after a fracture. His visit went as follows:</p>
<p>1:45 Patient called back for cast removal, because cast room is full patient placed in &#8220;x-ray room&#8221;</p>
<p>1:46 Resident visits patient in room and explains he is going to get cast removal gear</p>
<p>1:48 Resident wheels in cast removal gear and demonstrates how it works</p>
<p>1:55 Cast fully removed (with patient&#8217;s arm rested on C-arm)</p>
<p>1:56 Patient sent to radiology to get an x-ray</p>
<p>2:37 Patient back from x-ray waiting in cast room doorway</p>
<p>2:40 Patient moved to exam room</p>
<p>2:50 Patient&#8217;s mother in hallway looking for physician and explains that she&#8217;s just afraid they may be forgotten as they were in radiology</p>
<p>2:55 Patient seen by attending physician</p>
<p>2:58 Patient leaves</p>
<p>In all it took over an hour from being brought back from the waiting room to get a cast removed, an x-ray, and see the attending physician. While this is definitely not the norm in clinic, it demonstrates several inefficiencies that could be improved.</p>

I actively tried to broaden the scope of design I was considering beyond the prosthesis that are most often associated with orthopedic surgery.</p>
<p>I started by being on the lookout for work-arounds, barriers, re-purposed objects, and instances of user &#8220;torture&#8221;. The best example I saw occurred multiple times and with two different orthopods in different clinics when they wanted to explain a procedure, pathology, or anatomy to a patient. They would draw what they were talking about on the paper overlaying the exam bed. This method was very effective in explaining things to patients and allowed the patient to take the drawing home with them too. One example Dr. Gonzalez drew of thumb ulnar collateral ligament repair is pictured in the heading of this post.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;text-indent: -.25in">Good design observed this week</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Thumb UCL replacement surgery</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Proximity of physical therapy to the orthopedic department</span></li>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;text-indent: -.25in">Bad design observed this week</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Call center scheduling inappropriate patients for specialists</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Each physician had their own method for keeping track of their calendar which was backed up to the eMR</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">The computers in every exam room were never used</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">One last area that might benefit from innovation was encountered during a follow up with a patient who had some winging of his scapula as his muscles would get fatigued. The physician suggested that the patient take a friend to their PT appointment as a workout buddy. The workout buddy would be able to see when the scapula would wing and inform the patient. It seems that a mirror or video system might be an easier solution for this problem.</span></p>

Rown grew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin where his early interest in physics led him to undergraduate majors in nuclear engineering and math at the University of Wisconsin. His experience with innovation in medicine began as a medical physicist in radiation oncology and diagnostic imaging.
