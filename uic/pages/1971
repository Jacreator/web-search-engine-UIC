<p>The summer after his first year at UIC, Jinit Desai had the experience of a lifetime. Through the UIC Study Abroad Office, Desai joined the Institute for the International Education of Students Abroad (IES Abroad) Health Studies Program in Santiago, Chile. Following this seven-week experience in 2012, Desai was invited to present at a series of IES Abroad events.</p>
<p>Last semester, Desai presented at an IES Abroad all-staff meeting followed by an alumni reception. After these two outstanding presentations, Desai—a third-year neuroscience major—was given the opportunity to present to the IES Abroad Board of Directors on February 8 at their headquarters in Chicago.</p>
<p>Desai spoke to the board—which included IES Abroad President and CEO Dr. Mary Dwyer, a former faculty member at the UIC College of Medicine and a former Executive Associate Vice Chancellor for Research—about many aspects of his study abroad experience. He gave special focus to two classes he took in Chile: Spanish for Health Care Practitioners and a Clinical Observations Seminar. He was able to learn about the Chilean health care system, observe medical procedures, and experience the dichotomy between the rush of an emergency ward and the quiet of a hemodialysis unit. These varying experiences helped Desai realize that “aspiring to be an ordinary physician was no longer sufficient.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Desai feels that studying abroad is a great way to experience growth during college and beyond, helping to bring cultural competency to future medical professionals. “Especially for pre- medical students, it’s easy to cultivate a particular mindset when you’re just taking your required classes,” he explains.</p>
<p>Seeking to further expand his outlook, Desai also travelled to Costa Rica last summer through the UIC Study Abroad Office. He plans on returning to Chile this upcoming summer for a volunteer project with Voluntarios de la Esperanza Global (VE Global), an organization that brings volunteers to work with at-risk Chilean children. Desai realizes that he never would have sought out these experiences if not for that first trip: “Studying abroad will force you to seek out opportunities and broaden your horizons.”</p>

<p>With today’s economy, it is easy to overlook opportunities like studying abroad. Many students may wonder who has the time or budget to visit another country for an entire semester. Fortunately, there exists a scholarship that assists hard-working students from low-income families in paying for their study abroad experiences. The Gilman Program is invested in providing study abroad opportunities for traditionally underrepresented student groups with each award averaging $4,000. In order to be eligible for the Gilman Scholarship a student must demonstrate an excellent academic history and be a Federal Pell Grant recipient.</p>
<p>The Gilman Scholarship was the determining factor as to whether or not I could go abroad, and without it I would not have been able to spend my Fall 2013 semester in Barcelona, Spain conducting research on cross-cultural perspectives for the treatment of various mental illnesses. The lessons learned abroad are so incredibly valuable that no amount of credit hours can account for them. For example, we touched on theories of cultural relativism in my psychology classes and I was able to concretely put these theories into practice while interacting with locals on a day-to-day basis. It was the application of these concepts that made the lessons all the more effective and relevant to my future Capstone project.</p>
<p>With opportunities like the Gilman Scholarship, we are reminded that studying abroad is an experience that no student should feel excluded from. If you are interested in studying abroad there are a variety of scholarships available to all students, including through the Honors College. Visit the Study Abroad Office website for more details: http://www.uic.edu/depts/spec_prog/studyabroad/</p>

		<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kerry-gawne1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-586 alignleft" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kerry-gawne1.png" alt="kerry gawne" width="296" height="300" /></a>One of the first things that stands out about UIC senior Kerry Gawne when meeting her is her perpetual enthusiasm, which carries over to her education and involvement outside the classroom. A German major with minors in art history, English, and history, Gawne has a plethora of experiences and credentials. These qualifications helped her win a scholarship from the national German honor society, Delta Phi Alpha—the only one awarded in the nation. The scholarship is awarded on the basis of overall academic merit and the advancement and dedication of the student to the study of the German language and culture. Gawne will use the scholarship provision towards her continuing studies at Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany where she will begin a Master’s program in European history this fall.</p>
<p>Gawne spoke eagerly of the study abroad program she was a part of this previous summer in Berlin, Germany. She described her schedule during the month-long program organized by the UIC Department of Germanic Studies and hosted by the Humboldt University in Berlin: her mornings consisted of language instruction; during the afternoon and evenings Gawne and her classmates went on unique cultural excursions that other tourists wouldn’t be privy to—including watching films, visiting flea markets, and attending lectures about specific sites and regions. Another aspect of the program that Gawne relished was the fact that she had roommates from Prague and Paris, with whom she made lifelong friendships.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>In addition to studying abroad, Gawne has also been substantially involved with student organizations during her four years at UIC. She is currently the secretary and treasurer of the Student Centers Board and has been involved with Trade Winds, an organization through which students can mentor international students and make cross-cultural connections. She has also previously conducted research with Dr. David M. Sokol, Professor Emeritus of Art History, on the works of the German expressionist artist Otto Neumann. Cataloging the name, dimensions, and medium of each of the</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Society artist’s pieces were among the duties Gawne was assigned during her research experience. Additionally, she was a YP4 (Young People For) Fellow during her junior year, which she describes as “a year-long national fellowship for progressive youth leadership [rooted] in the ideals of social justice and being agents of change in our local communities.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The scholarship Gawne has received from Delta Phi Alpha will be an investment toward her postgraduate education which, in turn, will be an asset for her long-term goals. Gawne is interested in pursuing a career devoted to cross-cultural communication and someday wants to start a nonprofit organization dedicated to conflict resolution between ethnic groups, focusing on bridging gaps and helping people learn about other cultures. Advice she would give her peers would be to embrace diversity and interact with people from different backgrounds to gain new perspectives on life and develop a sense of empathy for others.</p>

<p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to study abroad with the School for International<br />
Training (SI T) World Learning to study various forms of traditional medicine that flourish in parts of Northern India. I encountered a spectrum of alternative medical systems, including faith-based healing, yoga, reflexology, Ayurveda, naturopathy, and Tibetan medicine. Most of these Eastern medical systems are more than 5,000 years old, yet they coexist with conventional medicine in parts of Asia. A universal underpinning of these alternative systems of medicine is the belief that<br />
the human body has innate healing capacities, and the purpose of medicine should be to augment those capacities through natural and holistic means, instead of ingesting potent drugs or using invasive means of treatment.</p>
<div>
<p>My SIT group first traveled to rural Nanital where we lived with the villagers and explored traditional faith-based healing prevalent in remote areas. We observed how practitioners and patients alike perceived mantra-based healing and the scope of its effects.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we traveled to Rishikesh, dubbed “the yoga capital of the world,” to learn about the philosophy and practice of yoga. I learned that the difference between more strenuous forms of exercise and yoga is that the former focus on movement, and the latter focuses on stillness. Aerobic exercises enlarge muscle mass by creating micro-tears in muscle fibers, whereas yoga postures, with their emphasis on flexibility, strengthen and tone the muscles, thereby carrying the effect beyond the tissues and into the organs. Moreover, I was able to experience the application of yoga in a clinical setting. Many physicians in India prescribe certain yoga poses to supplement the treatment of certain diseases. For example, diabetic patients are advised to perform yoga postures that stretch the abdominal region, such as the cobra and butterfly postures, because exerting pressure on the abdominal region enhances circulation to that area, stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My group also shadowed at a prestigious hospital in Palampur, the Kayakalp Institute, where all treatments offered were drugless. I learned about thousands of herbs and spices and their medicinal properties, and about the therapeutic effects of massages and mud</p>

<p>My group also shadowed at a prestigious hospital in Palampur, the Kayakalp Institute, where all treatments offered were drugless. I learned about thousands of herbs and spices and their medicinal properties, and about the therapeutic effects of massages and mud therapies in Ayurveda and naturopathy. Moreover, learning the basis of reflexology uncovered the mystery of why foot massages are so relaxing.</p>
<p>Our last excursion was to Dharamsala, a city in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Dalai Lama and the exiled Tibetan government reside. Tibetan medicine is closely intertwined with Buddhist philosophy, and practitioners of this system believe that all of us are sick until we surpass all forms of ignorance. Even if there is no conspicuous physical illness, ignorance gives rise to mental illness, and states of anger, desire, and other afflictive emotions are considered in Tibetan medicine to be reflective of one’s mental health.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>My experiences this past summer have shaped my understanding of medicine as a dynamic anthropological creation. When we think about health, we are accustomed to thinking in terms of disease. But, I’ve come to realize that health is not merely the absence of disease, and that a holistic conception of health is necessary in treating the entire gamut of human afflictions. I am eternally grateful to the Gilman Scholarship, the Foundation for Global Scholars, the UIC Asian American Native American and Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAAPISI) Scholarship Program, the UIC Honors College, and SIT for making my trip possible and affording me this great opportunity.</p>
