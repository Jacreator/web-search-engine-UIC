        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A graduate student may take 
          courses on the credit/no credit option provided that: (1) The courses 
          are not within the student's immediate area of specialization, (2) such 
          courses account for no more than one sixth of the total number of course 
          hours taken at UIC and counted toward a degree, and (3) the student 
          submits the Credit/No Credit Option Form to the Graduate College by 
          the tenth day of the fall or spring terms (fifth day of the summer term), 
          with an advisor's signature. This option cannot be revoked after the 
          close of the (tenth day of instruction - fall and spring terms)(fifth 
          day of instruction - summer term). The student registers and pays for 
          the course using the normal registration procedures. Note that some 
          departments do not allow any credit/no credit hours to be used toward 
          a degree, although courses not used toward a degree may be taken credit/no 
          credit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instructors are not informed 
          that the option has been elected, but assign a letter grade in the usual 
          manner. The Office of Admissions and Records retains a record of the 
          letter grade, but it is not entered on the student transcript. A grade 
          of CR is recorded on the transcript if a letter grade of A, B, or C 
          is earned. A grade of NC is recorded on the transcript if a letter grade 
          of D or F is assigned. I and DFR grades are replaced by CR or NC upon 
          completion of the course(s). The grades of CR and NC are not used in 
          the computation of the grade point average.</font></p>
