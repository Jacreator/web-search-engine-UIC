<p>Given the highly competitive nature of the Access Path to Psychology and Law (AP) program, only five awards are distributed nationally every year. This year, two recipients, Kaitlynn Richardson and Brandon Garcia, are Honors College students and currently work in the lab of Honors College Dean Emerita Dr. Bette Bottoms. The AP program aims to diversify the fields of psychology and law by encouraging faculty members to recruit underrepresented graduate school applicants in their research labs. The program provides financial support for the recipients to garner research experience and opportunities for mentoring and professional development.</p>
<p>Kaitlynn Richardson, a sophomore majoring in psychology and biological sciences, was recruited by Bottoms and applied to the AP program because it intersected with her interest in psychology as a pre-med student. Richardson has been working in Bottoms’ lab, where she has learned common research methods in psychology, such as coding transcripts and data entry. Through the AP program, Richardson hopes to complete her Capstone project, which will examine the correlation between race and animal abuse. Brandon Garcia, a first-generation college junior majoring in psychology and</p>
<p>Brandon Garcia, a first-generation college junior majoring in psychology and criminology, law, and justice, was also recruited by Bottoms and applied to the AP program. Garcia hopes to use the AP grant to fund an ongoing study in the lab regarding juries and their reaction to animal abuse. Working alongside Richardson for an average of 10 hours a week, Garcia’s tasks involve data collection and analyses.</p>
<p>Garcia and Richardson both attended the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) national conference in Seattle in March. Both students plan to use their time in the AP program to develop their Capstone projects. Students interested in developing and implementing their research projects in psychology or law can apply for the AP program by December 2017.</p>

<p>Liz Stark, a current senior majoring in the Teaching of Mathematics Secondary Education, was this year’s recipient. Stark’s goal after graduation is to work for Chicago Public Schools as a high school math teacher and ultimately teach at her alma mater, Lane Tech High School. Stark is not only an exceptional student, but also has been an active member in many Honors College organizations, such as the Honors College Ambassadors, the student representative for the Honors Council, and the Honors College Student Leadership Council. Stark was also a member of the Honors College Advisory Board for three years, where she served as the Freshman Representative, Secretary, and President.</p>
<p>When asked about her favorite Honors activity, Stark mentions that joining HCAB during freshman year and eventually serving as President of the organization was a truly memorable experience. As President, she was able to “fundraise for scholarships, organize the Honors College Ball, and plan student social events throughout the year.” The leadership roles Stark has taken on during her time in the Honors College “helped [her] become more organized, creative, and collaborative.” Stark hopes to utilize the skills she has gained in her future career as a math teacher. Stark values her relationships with Honors College students, staff, and professors, and appreciates that the Honors community provided her “a small liberal arts college environment inside a large research university.” The Honors College congratulates Stark once again for her accomplishments!</p>

<p>Sarita Deshpande, an Honors College senior majoring in bioengineering, has been named a Gates Cambridge Scholar. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship was established by Bill and Melinda Gates as a $210 million endowment in order to enable exceptional students to complete a postgraduate degree at the University of Cambridge in the UK. Sarita will be pursuing an MPhil in Medical Sciences at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences for a year.</p>
<p>As a bioengineering major, Deshpande has research experience in modeling physiological cell and tissue interactions in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and in the Department of Bioengineering where she conducts image processing and segmentation of optical coherence tomography angiography images. She participated in the Clinical Immersion Program through UIC’s Department of Bioengineering, which allowed her to explore the close relationship between bioengineering and medicine by conducting needs assessments and identifying medical device problems in the healthcare setting. She also serves as the editor-in-chief of the Ampersand and the UIC Bioengineering Student Journal.</p>
<p>At Cambridge, Deshpande will be studying mechanisms of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucomatous models, which can provide insight into the development of novel therapeutic options. Deshpande is “humbled and honored to have received this opportunity and to be a part of such a diverse and dynamic group of scholars,” and she is excited to join the vibrant community of Gates Cambridge Scholars as she takes the next step in her education.</p>

<p>Chicago provides a vibrant environment for artists like Drew Richardson to achieve milestones in their work. Richardson, an Honors College junior majoring in Studio Art, recently crafted two art pieces for the Black Creativity Juried Art Exhibition at the Museum of Science and Industry. The exhibition, which was open from January 16 to February 19, provides a venue for African-American art students to explore and expand their creativity.</p>
<p>Richardson attributes his success to years of practice and intense focus. I sat down with Drew to discuss the story behind his latest achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there any major themes that you commit to when creating art? </strong></p>
<p><strong>DR:</strong> I do like to focus on a specific theme when I’m doing a piece of art. At first, I liked to keep it neutral—I didn’t want my art to attract any sort of controversy. The first concentration I did, called Pieces of Me, was about young people putting themselves together, which was a very important concept to me as a young person trying to find myself. But it wasn’t something I was making to challenge a social order. Lately, given the current political climate, I believe it’s my duty to talk about more controversial things.</p>
<p>My two winning pieces are both about AfricanAmerican struggles. One of the winning pieces, called “Don’t Stop the Music,” is about how music is such an integral part of the African-American experience, because African-Americans have used music for hundreds of years to get through some of the worst conditions you can imagine. The other [piece], however, attracted more attention and is called The Machine. And yes, it is about AfricanAmericans to a degree, but it is also about Latinos, about incarcerated people, about police brutality, about climate change, poverty, pollution. I do think it’s important for me as an artist to engage in the conversation of social criticism.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I know you have quite an extensive art background. How long have you been an artist? </strong></p>
<p><strong>DR:</strong> I think I’ve been an artist for about five years now. Essentially, I started out as someone who didn’t necessarily know if he wanted to pursue art as a career. All I knew was that I liked it, and it was able to calm me down and give me joy and excitement in a very difficult time in my life. A lot of my family noticed I had a talent for it, so we decided to pursue it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Has your time at UIC influenced the evolution of your art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR</strong>: One really good thing about UIC is its diversity. It’s not something that you always notice, especially in high school. There are so many different voices, there are so many different viewpoints, and the students here are so aware and socially conscious. Here, there are so many conversations to participate in, and it energizes me.</p>
<p>After graduating, Richardson plans to complete internships that will offer him worthwhile experiences. He also anticipates managing his own art gallery one day.</p>

<p>Mariel Rancel, an Honors College junior majoring in biological sciences and minoring in nutrition and chemistry, is also participating in the Urban Public Policy Fellowship (UPPF), which introduces undergraduate students from underrepresented communities to public policy issues through weekly seminars and an internship experience. Rancel’s experiences with UIC’s Latin American Recruitment and Educational Services program (LARES) motivated her to be part of UPPF by introducing her to issues of civic engagement and social justice. The UPPF internship has allowed Rancel to pursue her interests in maternal and infant nutrition, and consider their implications for public policy.</p>
<p>For the duration of the internship, Rancel attends seminars where various speakers involved in public policy come to talk with the interns; for example, Brenna Conway, the Illinois Director of the Roosevelt Institute, spoke to the interns about strategies on networking and how to advocate for issues they find important. StateRepresentative Will Davis, 30th District, also held a seminar with the interns.</p>
<p>As a part of her internship, Rancel works at the Catholic Charities site, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), where she develops newsletters for the food program, posters with recipes for the holiday season, and healthy recipes to make with the WIC food. Rancel thought that the most fun part of her internship was “packing sandwiches.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Rancel’s research topic for the duration of the internship is WIC policy. She will be analyzing data regarding redemption rates of the vouchers that mothers in the WIC program receive from the WIC clinics every three months, as well as the factors that may influence redemption rates, such as acculturation, age of the mother, hours of TV watched at home, and marital status. Of particular interest is the redemption rate of the fruits and vegetables that were added to the program in 2009. At the end of the spring semester, Rancel will present her research, which will also serve as her Capstone Project.</p>

<p>Honors College junior Chris Kooy is participating in the Urban Public Policy Fellowship (UPPF) at UIC this year. UPPF, a program that introduces undergraduate students from underrepresented communities to public policy issues, matches student interns with organizations across the city. The aspiring foreign service officer has been busy interning with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), a nationally recognized nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the civil rights of Latinos in America through advocacy for policy reforms, litigation, and community outreach. Kooy, a political</p>
<p>Kooy, a political science and Spanish major, decided to participate in the year-long internship with MALDEF because of his interest in one issue in particular: immigration policy. He professes, “Immigration policy is one of the things I’m most passionate about.” He works with legislative staff attorneys and litigation attorneys to translatelegal documents, analyze data relating to Illinois demographics and electoral history, and construct spreadsheets of Latino non-profit organizations in Chicago.</p>
<p>Kooy’s work with MALDEF has been particularly important in this year’s presidential election. His mentors are involved with sending out information that circulates through Latino constituencies. He has been directly involved with creating directories, voter rights summaries, and guides on how to register to vote. All of these efforts help to increase civic engagement.</p>
<p>Though his internship has just started, Kooy has already learned the complexities of writing legal briefs, starting cases, and arguing before a judge. He plans on getting a head start on his Capstone project through the internship. Kooy recommends the rigorous program to any student interested in policy, regardless of their educational goals. He reminds students, “Policy affects just about everything.”</p>

<p>The Lincoln Laureate Award from the Lincoln Academy of Illinois is given each year to recognize one outstanding senior from each four-year institution in Illinois for his or her academic achievement, leadership, and service. This year, the Lincoln Laureate from UIC is Rafid Rahman, Honors College senior majoring in biological sciences and anthropology.</p>
<p>As a freshman, Rahman researched health disparities at Rush University. He also has research experiences at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, UIC College of Medicine, and Harvard Medical School, where he studied cancer immunology this past summer. While balancing his schoolwork and his commitments as a pre-medical student, Rahman has led multiple organizations and services around campus that focus on giving back to the community.</p>
<p>Rahman founded and led the College of Cycling, which hosts bike riding events and workshops in Chicago while promoting the benefits of cycling. This organization partners with UIC Dining Services to deliver by bike over 500 meals of leftover food from the cafeteria to a local homeless shelter. In addition to the College of Cycling, Rahman was also formerly the president of the New Life Volunteering Society, a tutoring organization through which UIC students volunteer at Chicago Public Schools every week.</p>
<p>However, Rahman’s contributions to the community are not limited to the UIC campus. The most recent organization that he started this year is MedSpeak, a YouTube channel that creates videos addressing and answering questions about the process of applying to and going to medical school. Rahman seeks answers to these questions from professors, admission committee advisors, and medical school students themselves.</p>
<p>In the future, Rahman aspires to integrate peer health education with social media and news station media, extending his work with MedSpeak. He plans to get involved in healthcare outreach projects by providing information regarding health and medicine to news stations and on social media platforms. Rahman will be attending medical school at the University of Toledo next fall and is dedicated to becoming a physician and researcher. He also hopes to be part of an admissions committee for a medical school or a medical correspondent at a news channel.</p>
<p>Rahman believes that his leadership and volunteering have contributed to his future goals. “[These activities] all have the aspect of outreach and volunteerism, so I think those ideas and principles have translated into what I want to do and how I want to give back to others,” stated Rahman. He advises students who want to be more involved in their communities to start with any club they’re interested in and see where the organization takes them from there. “Life is a journey,” he commented, “you really need to just ride it out and along the way you’ll figure out exactly what you want.”</p>

<p>Deborah Park, a senior Honors College student, has been awarded the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship. This nationally competitive scholarship of up to $7,500 per year is awarded to junior and senior undergraduates who plan on pursuing a research career in the sciences, mathematics, or engineering. Park is one of 250 students who received the Goldwater scholarship from a pool of 1,150 qualified applicants.</p>
<p>Park’s motivation to apply for the scholarship was her cancer research. She is currently studying the biological mechanisms of the overexpression of the protein PDLIM-5 in lung cancer patients with Dr. Guofei Zhou, assistant professor of pediatrics in the UIC College of Medicine. In addition to her research, Park believes that her essays played an important role in getting the scholarship.</p>
<p>Overall, Park not only received financial support from the scholarship but she also benefitted from the process of applying. “Applying to scholarships forces you to think about what your motivations are, why you do the things that you do,” Park said.</p>
<p>In the future, Park plans on pursuing a career in academic medicine. She advises undergraduates interested in the Goldwater scholarship to manage their time and reach out to campus resources such as the Office of Special Scholarship Programs. “Make sure you give yourself enough time to apply, and make sure you have people who are willing to read over your essays and give you critiques,” Park said.</p>

<p>Ann Hsieh started her freshman year by representing the United States in the 2016 Junior Pan-American Karate Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Hsieh, a freshman Honors College student majoring in industrial design, competed against the best athletes from all of North, South, and Central America. She placed 7th in the 18–20 female Kumite, or fighting/sparring, division. The United States National Team earned 10 gold medals, 5 silver medals, and 14 bronze medals at the competition, earning the highest medal count over Brazil and Venezuela.</p>
<p>By the age of 8, Hsieh was already mastering karate. She now trains at the Illinois Shotokan Karate Club (ISKC), which is the largest karate club in the United States with over 7,000 students. Hsieh and her teammates from ISKC represented 16 out of the 75 total members on the US Junior National Team. Each country is only allowed to send two competitors for each division for the Pan-American Karate Championships, which highlights the competitive nature of the selection process. At the competition, Hsieh fought hard against competitors from Brazil and Canada, leading to an overall 7th place finish.</p>
<p>Hsieh sees karate as an outlet from studies and a way to relax. This allows her to manage about 15 hours of practice with school. She loves how karate helps maintain both physical and mental fitness. Hsieh hopes to represent USA in Italy for the Shotokan Karate World Championships, Argentina for the Junior Pan American Championships, and Egypt for the Junior World Championships. She hopes to try out for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, which is the first year that karate will be included in the Games.</p>

<p>Each year, the prestigious Lincoln Academy of Illinois awards the Lincoln Student Laureate to one graduating senior from each four-year college and university in Illinois. The honor recognizes students who demonstrated excellence throughout their four years both in and out of the classroom. UIC had the privilege of recognizing Taylor Casino, an Honors College student majoring in marketing, this 2015–2016 school year.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Student Laureate is based on recommendations and comments from the student’s professors and advisors. In November, all 60 recipients were invited to Springfield to receive the honor. Despite the different schools and backgrounds, Casino noted how truly similar the recipients were, as they all shared a deep appreciation of their universities through their involvement in academic and extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>In her freshman year at UIC, Casino became involved with the University Ambassadors, a group that is responsible for professional development, networking opportunities for members, and school spirit. Casino attributes the emergence of her leadership experience to this organization. She began her University Ambassador career as a general member and became more involved as Head of Professional Development. In this role, Casino prepared presentations and organized speaking events focused on how to become successful in the workplace. Casino went on to develop her leadership abilities as Head of Advocacy Committee and President of the student organization, where she continues to help younger students develop their professional skills.</p>
<p>In addition to these leadership positions, Casino served as Senior Associate Orientation Director. Her responsibilities included interviewing, hiring, and training the 30 student Orientation Leaders who helped welcome approximately 3,000 incoming students this past summer. This leadership position allowed Casino to gain real world executive experience in the familiar environment of UIC Orientation. Casino remarked that she enjoyed having students approach her during the school year and praise their orientation experience. Also a member of the College of Business, she is involved in UIC’s Business Scholars Program, through which she works with the other Business Scholars to create an enriching environment for networking and professional growth. Casino is among a unique and elite group of students who continuously strive to make the most of their educational and leadership experiences here at UIC. Her dedication and hard work is proven time and time again.</p>
<p>As graduation draws closer, Casino reflects on this award and her time at UIC, as she plans for the future. Hoping to gain new perspectives, she plans to take a year off after graduation to travel throughout Japan. However, she is also open to other possibilities and looks forward to where the next few years will take her. Casino encourages fellow students to take advantage of all opportunities that come their way. Taking to heart a phrase a previous supervisor told her, “Life is 5% of what you plan, and 95% of how you react.”</p>
