<p>Stephanie Vondell, Honors College senior and theater major, rehearsed for over 18 hours every week to prepare for the UIC production of The Secret in the Wings. The Secret in the Wings is an adaptation of classic, lesser-known fairy tales that reflects the dark nature of childhood. This play is about Bianca, a child who goes on multiple suspenseful adventures with her babysitter. In The Secret in the Wings, Vondell plays the roles of one of the Three Blind Queens and Steph.</p>
<p>Vondell always had an interest in acting, and began acting in plays and commercials when she was in high school. During her time at UIC, she has participated in several productions, as well as a student-produced short film. Vondell describes her involvement in The Secret in the Wings as one of her most memorable experiences in a play. “It’s so different because all of the characters are on stage all the time&#8230; There’s one main character but that doesn’t even matter because…we each lead a story but the stories all are connected,” Vondell said.</p>
<p>Vondell currently works as a marketing and production assistant at Artemisia Theatre. After graduation, she plans to continue her work there, audition for more roles, and venture into vocal work. The Secret in the Wings played at UIC Theater Chicago from November 11th–19th.</p>

<p><span class="tx f43">I’ve always wondered how people in one area of the world can be so different from</span><br />
<span class="tx">people in another. Different cultures, different values, different traditions. This wondrous feeling </span><span class="tx">arises from growing up in two very different cultures. Surprisingly, I can still vividly remember </span><span class="tx">many of my childhood experiences growing up in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. I remember the </span><span class="tx">fun times of laughing and playing with all my classmates during recess, going late-night </span><span class="tx">shopping at the beautiful bazaars, spending quality time with outgoing neighbors, and strolling </span><span class="tx">the splendid food streets. My life was perfect at that time. I was excelling in my academics. My </span><span class="tx">social life was very active. My parents had given my siblings and I so much love and support,</span><span class="tx">and our family was always there for us in occasional times of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="tx">For mostly financial reasons, my parents decided to move to the United States while I </span><span class="tx">was in the middle of fifth grade. I suddenly became pretty upset and nervous. Even the thought </span><span class="tx">of leaving all my friends and family behind made me feel depressed. To top that, I was anxious </span><span class="tx">about adjusting to a completely new lifestyle and culture. The only image I knew of the United </span><span class="tx">States was from television and movies. I had an image of harsh and snowy winters, English-</span><span class="tx">speaking Americans, and extremely luxurious houses and facilities. The adjustment was as rough </span><span class="tx">as I expected it to be. I remember the first day entering my 5th grade classroom and feeling the </span><span class="tx">constant stares and judg</span><span class="tx">men</span><span class="tx">tal looks given by my classmates. E</span><span class="tx f43">ven my teacher didn’t quite </span><span class="tx">understand that the education</span><span class="tx">al</span><span class="tx"> system in Pakistan was completely different from the</span><span class="tx"> system in </span><span class="tx">the</span><span class="tx"> United States, and as a result of this, my grades suffered for the first few months. I had never </span><span class="tx">experienced engaged classroom discussions and group projects due to the fact that in Pakistan, I </span><span class="tx">was used to learning on my own from textbooks. To top that, I had trouble making friends</span><span class="tx">,</span><span class="tx"> as my </span><span class="tx">American classmates did not share the same values as I did. For example, I was unfamiliar with </span><span class="tx">recess games and entertainment activities of the United States. I remember being constantly</span><br />
<span class="tx f43">bullied by a girl just because I didn’t wear branded and fancy clothes from Nordstrom; she told </span><span class="tx f43">me I couldn’t be part of her clique. It took me about a year to find </span><span class="tx">friends with the same values</span><span class="tx"> ,</span><span class="tx">and overcome many emotional challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="tx">Even though the adjustment to life in the United States was very difficult, I currently feel </span><span class="tx">very grateful to have experienced growing up in two very different cultures. From the bullying </span><span class="tx">and loneliness I experienced, I have learned that I should treat everyone with kindness. I believe</span><span class="tx">I have developed some crucial problem-solving skills. I have learned to think in original and </span><span class="tx">creative ways since I have been exposed to different perspectives of many customs and </span><span class="tx">traditions. I have also gained a lot of confidence. If I can overcome the challenges of adjusting to </span><span class="tx">a completely new culture, I can overcome any unpleasant and unexpected surprises that arise in </span><span class="tx">life.</span></p>

<p>Over the summer, a select group of students and faculty participated in the exciting new Summer Diabetes Research program. The UIC Department of Surgery and Department of Bioengineering partnered with the Honors College to offer 12 motivated students the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary diabetes research. The 10-week program—led by Dr. José Oberholzer, Professor of Surgery, Bioengineering, and Endocrinology, Director of the Islet and Pancreas Transplant Program, and the Chief of the Division of Transplantation at UIC—featured seminarbased lectures centered on biotechnology innovation in advanced diabetes research. Students worked with 19 supporting faculty on individual research projects with the ultimate goal of developing “a cell-based functional cure for diabetes.”</p>
<p>After 10 years of implementing a similar program with Chicago-area high school students, researchers leading the program received a grant from the National Institutes of Health to extend the opportunity to UIC undergraduates. Dr. Oberholzer approached former Dean Bette Bottoms about partnering with the Honors College because of its reputation for academic rigor and leadership.</p>
<p>The summer program proved to be a huge success. After 20 seminar-based classes, 12 skill workshops, and clinical immersion, which gave students the chance to watch surgery in the operating room at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, the student researchers presented their projects at a closing ceremony.</p>
<p>Despite having no prior research experience, Honors College student Kenneth Booker decided to get involved in the program and worked with Dr. Solomon Afelik, Assistant Professor at the Division of Transplantation of the Department of Surgery, to study human pancreatic beta cell proliferation. Another Honors College student in the program, Katherine Xie, assessed different human islet, or pancreatic, cell preparations. The research of Honors College students participating in the program will contribute to diabetes treatment.</p>
<p>Booker did not begin seriously thinking about pursuing a career in medical research until the past year. Since completing the program, he said that being part of the work “that changes lives&#8230; solidified [his] prospects of medical school.” When thinking back on her experience with the program, Xie said, “Clinical research&#8230;takes the best of both worlds, medicine and bench research, and creates a transformative experience for anyone involved.” She also noted that the program “left [her] with a set of summer memories [she] will never forget.”</p>
<p>The Summer Diabetes Research Program will continue in the summer of 2017. Students interested in participating in the program should be “UIC undergraduates, especially from the Honors College, who are from traditionally underrepresented racial, gender, and ethnic groups in the STEM and biomedical research fields.” Student participants receive a $3,000 stipend for the 10-week program. More information about the application process will be available in November 2016 on the Honors College website (www.honors.uic.edu) and the Chicago Diabetes Project website (www. chicagodiabetesproject.org).</p>

<p>While many of us spend the summer taking classes, working, or catching up on Netflix, UIC Honors College senior Przemyslaw Lukacz— an anthropology and psychology double major with a minor in religious studies—was busy conducting ethnographic research in Peru during the summer of 2013.</p>
<p>Lukacz’s research, which focused on the mythology of the Shipibo people of southern Peru, is the basis for his Capstone project this year. He became interested in the topic after first visiting Peru and seeing the unique patterns on their textiles. The Shipibo community has managed to preserve its traditional mythology despite encroaching colonial influences. Lukacz is interested in how they embody mythology, specifically the use of Icaros songs incorporated into healing practices. By collecting electroencephalographic data, Lukacz hopes to apply a neuroscience perspective—measuring how the brain of a patient changes during these healing rituals since they are exposed to different musical stimuli.</p>
<p>To mentally prepare for interactions with the Shipibo, Lukacz commented that it was important to leave behind Western thinking in order to understand a completely “different cognitive landscape,” as the Shipibo have very different concepts about how to interact with their environment. For instance, they believe that the forest is alive with spirits, and they use plant intoxicants during their ritual life. “What I find beautiful more than difficult,” Lukacz said, “is to forget who we are and try to see the world as these people see it.”</p>
<p>He praised his Faculty Fellow, Dr. Anna C. Roosevelt, and Dean Keen for being amazing advisors throughout the course of his research project. He has also received a grant from the Honors College to aid in funding his fascinating Capstone. Lukacz is passionate about his work and as a result, he will be traveling back to Peru for approximately five weeks in May 2016 to continue his research.</p>
