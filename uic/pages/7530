Quantity ordered is determined by the volume of examinations to be performed.</p><p>Control and Distribution:</p><p>The control and distribution are managed by the MR Research Technologist and/or Clinical Research Coordinator. The contrast media will be maintained in a locked cabinet appropriately designated for this purpose.</p><p>Administration:</p><p>The contrast media type, quantity and method of administration is determined and ordered by the Director of the Center for MR Research after reviewing and identifying the patient&#8217;s clinical data, and the history obtained from the patient&#8217;s medical record.</p><p>Monitoring:</p><p>During and following the contrast media injection, the patient is observed by the technologist and/or clinical research coordinator. If any adverse effects occur, action will be taken consistent with HPMM EC3.01 Patient Occurrence Reporting and TX 2.04 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Reporting.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 8/01</p><h2>Policy 6: Informed Consent for Non-Experimental Procedures and Treatment</h2><p>The Center for MR Research (a) treats all Center for MR Research patients only with their voluntary and informed consent or that of their legally authorized representative and (b) ensures that these consents are appropriately documented.</p><p>DEFINITIONS</p><p>For the purpose of this policy, the following definitions apply:</p><p>An adult is any individual age 18 years or older or any individual recognized as an adult under Illinois law.</p><p>Competent is defined as understanding the nature and benefits of one&#8217;s action.</p><p>An emancipated minor is an individual under 18 years of age and for whom the circuit court of the county where the minor resides orders that the minor is emancipated for some or all purposes. Emancipation by court action may occur when a minor can support himself/herself without parental assistance. The court order shall indicate the specific rights and responsibilities of the emancipated minor. One of these specific rights might be to consent for his or her own medical procedures or treatments. Emancipation of a minor also occurs by marriage.</p><p>An emergency is a sudden, unexpected occurrence in which there is an imminent danger to an individual&#8217;s life or limb and which demands immediate medical attention.</p><p>Informed Consent is the permission granted by the patient (or his or her legally authorized representative) for procedures or treatments after being informed about the possible benefits, possible substantial risks, possible alternative treatments, and the probability of success involved in the procedures or treatments.</p><p>A legally authorized representative is an individual who is authorized to make decisions for the patient either by a durable power of attorney (see UIMC HMPP RI 4.02, Addendum 2 Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care Form) or by adjudication (see UIMC HMPP RI 5.01 Healthcare Surrogate and RI 5.02 Guardianship Petitions [for Adult Patients]).</p><p>A minor is an individual under age 18 years.</p><p>The responsible physician, unless otherwise noted, is the patient&#8217;s primary attending physician or resident (a) to whom responsibility for the patient has been delegated, (b) who will assist the attending physician, or (c) who performs the procedure under the supervision of the attending physician.</p><p>A substantial risk is one which a reasonable individual in the patient&#8217;s position would find important in determining his or her course of action e.g. side effects occurring in greater than 1% of patients treated; loss of life, limb, or special sense organ; or disability.</p><p>Voluntary is defined as being freely chose or undertaken of one&#8217;s own free will.</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>The Center for MR Research requires the physician responsible for the patient to:</p><p>1. Discuss with the patient (or his or her legally-authorized representative) at a minimum, the possible benefits of the procedure to the individual, substantial risks, possibilities of any material side effects involved in the procedure, medically significant alternative forms of treatment, problems related to recuperation, and probability of success of any proposed procedure.</p><p>a. If the patient is competent and does not want discussion with the family, the physician shall honor this request.<br /> b. This process must occur prior to the administration of barbiturates, controlled substances or similar agents.</p><p>2. Have the patient (or his or her legally-authorized representative) provide voluntary, informed, signed and witnessed consent prior to the initiation of a procedure. This obligation cannot be delegated to anyone other than the physician. Obtain a new consent for each procedure, unless two separate procedures are done at one time; however, the consent form must detail what procedures are to be done.</p><p>3. Write a progress note, including that the discussion occurred and an opinion of the patient&#8217;s understanding of the process, diagnosis, and complications per UICMC HMPP IM 4.01 Medical Records: Documentation, Addendum 1 Documentation Requirements, page 4 Point G &#8220;Informed Consent (Form and Progress Note).</p><p>A separate Center for MR Research policy and procedure governs informed consent for research protocols consistent with UICMC HMPP RI 6.01 Informed Consent for Research Protocols.</p><p>Illinois Department of Children and Family Service (DCFS) wards age 18 and over provide their own consent.</p><p>The DCFS Guardianship Administrator is responsible for consenting to medical procedures for DCFS wards less than 18 years of age. Consent for procedures may be obtained only from Authorized Agents of the Guardianship Administrator (see UICMC HMPP IM 4.01 Medical Records: Addendum 3 Obtaining Legal Consent for DCFS Wards). Absent an emergency where consent is not required, neither foster parents, caseworkers, nor institutional staff members have authority to legally consent to medical treatment for these wards.</p><p>GENERAL CONSENTS:</p><p>The general consent covers:</p><p>a. Emergency procedures which must be performed prior discussion to obtain a specific informed consent;<br /> b. Non-invasive radiological procedures</p><p>SPECIFIC CONSENTS:</p><p>A specific informed consent discussion must occur and the patient (or his or her legally-authorized representative) must consent in writing before any of the following procedures may take place:</p><p>a. Any procedure in which anesthesia, other than topical anesthesia, is used regardless of whether an entry into the body occurs;<br /> b. All treatments which involve substantial risk or harm</p><p>The patient&#8217;s specific consent is required for each procedure; a consent statement covering two or more procedures is not valid. The patient&#8217;s specific consent covers only the procedure discussed with the patient.</p><p>HOW COMPLETE THE INFORMED CONSENT DISCUSSION MUST BE:</p><p>The responsible physician must provide the patient with the information that a prudent person in the patient&#8217;s position would need to know in order to decide whether to undergo a proposed procedure. The test for completeness of this information in Illinois is whether the information provided by the responsible physician is essentially the same information that a physician with the same level of training or experience would provide to a patient in the same or similar circumstances. Risks known by the average patient need not be disclosed. Potential benefit(s) and drawback(s) of the proposed procedure, problems related to recuperation and the likelihood of success shall be explained. Information regarding significant alternative procedure(s) shall be provided.</p><p>WHO MUST OBTAIN CONSENT:</p><p>The responsible physician who must discuss the procedure with the patient and who shall obtain the patient&#8217;s consent in particular treatment categories listed below:</p><p>1. Invasive procedures of a diagnostic nature:</p><p>a. The physician performing or in charge of the procedure shall be responsible for ensuring the patient has been informed properly regarding the procedure and has consented to them</p><p>b. The anesthesiologist involved in the procedure shall be responsible for ensuring that the patient has been informed properly regarding the anesthesia to be used during the procedures and has been consented to them.</p><p>2. Non-invasive procedures of a diagnostic nature:</p><p>Where a substantial risk of harm exists, the physician supervising the procedure shall be responsible for ensuring that the patient has been informed properly regarding the procedures and has consented to it.</p><p>WHEN CONSENT MUST BE OBTAINED:</p><p>The responsible physician must obtain the patient&#8217;s consent:</p><p>1. Not earlier than six (6) weeks before the procedure is performed. If there are any changes in the patient&#8217;s medical condition or in the nature of the procedure, the responsible physician must verbally verify the consent and note such discussion in the patient&#8217;s medical record.</p><p>2. Whenever the patient&#8217;s medical condition changes substantially necessitating a change in performance of a procedure or when the course of treatment may be altered significantly for other reasons.</p><p>The informed consent discussion and the patient&#8217;s specific consent must be obtained prior to the administration of barbiturates, narcotics or similar agents involved in the procedure or psychotropic medications.</p><p>If a patient expresses a wish to cancel or revoke the consent, the consent shall be considered invalid at that point in time.</p><p>FROM WHOM CONSENT MUST BE OBTAINED:</p><p>1. Competent Adult Patient:</p><p>Competent adult patients shall give or withhold consent for their own procedures.</p><p>2. Incompetent Adult Patient:</p><p>If an adult patient is not competent, his or her legally-authorized representative shall grant or withhold consent for any procedure involving that patient that otherwise would have required the patient&#8217;s written consent (consistent with HMPP RI 5.02).</p><p>If the patient presents in an inebriated condition and his or her alcohol blood level is greater than 0.1GM% (100mg/dl, 1mg/ml), the procedure shall not proceed unless an emergency exists; if his or her alcohol blood level is less than 0.1 GM% (100mg/dl, 1mg/ml), the physician shall exercise clinical judgment and document that the patient understands the information given prior to the initiation of the procedure.</p><p>In recognizing the importance of family involvement, where an adult patient is clinically incompetent and a written consent is not required, a physician may be guided by a family member&#8217;s consent in providing further professional services consistent with the proper standard of care. It is recommended that informed consent be obtained from the following family members, in the order listed-</p><p>a. Spouse;<br /> b. Adult child;<br /> c. Parent; then<br /> d. Adult brother or sister.</p><p>If an adult patient is incompetent and his or her legally authorized representative is not physically present, the legally authorized representative may consent to the procedure by telephone or by sending a telegram indicating consent. To be valid, telephone consent must be verified by at least two witnesses.</p><p>3. Minor Patient</p><p>a. If a patient is a minor, his or her legally authorized representative shall grant or withhold consent for any procedure involving that patient unless the patient is emancipated or unless federal or state law provides otherwise. Unless the situation indicates otherwise, as in the case with DCFS wards, the parent or parents of a minor child are implicitly considered the child&#8217;s legally authorized representative(s) and may consent or withhold consent for that minor child&#8217;s procedure.</p><p>If the patient is a minor and his or her legally authorized representative is not physically present, the legally authorized representative may consent to the procedure by telephone or by sending a telegram indicating consent. To be valid, telephone consent must be verified by at least two witnesses.</p><p>b. A minor who is married, who is legally emancipated or who is pregnant may consent or withhold consent for any procedure.<br /> c. A minor who is a parent may grant consent for procedures for his or her child.</p><p>MUST CONSENT BE OBTAINED IN MEDICAL EMERGENCIES</p><p>If an emergency exists and it is not reasonably feasible to obtain consent without adversely affecting the patient&#8217;s condition, the healthcare professional shall render appropriate emergency treatment without the patient&#8217;s informed consent.</p><p>The responsible physician shall document in the medical record the clinical nature of the emergency and what reasonable attempts were made to contact the patient&#8217;s legally authorized representative to obtain consent.</p><p>MUST INFORMED CONSENT FORMS BE USED</p><p>If the clinical department has developed a consent form for a particular procedure it shall be used to document that the informed consent discussion occurred and that the patient voluntarily consented. If no consent form has been developed, the responsible physician shall:<br /> 1. Note in the medical record the content of the informed consent discussion and that the patient voluntarily consented; and<br /> 2. Use the standard form filling in the particular procedure and have the patient sign.</p><p>After the informed consent form discussion has occurred and after determining that the patient understands and voluntarily consents, the responsible physician shall fill out, sign, have the patient sign a consent form, and have the execution of the form witnessed. Any competent adult, including hospital personnel (except the attending physician) may witness the patient executing the consent form. By signing as a &#8220;witness&#8221;, the individual represents observing the patient sign the consent form voluntarily.</p><p>A copy of the consent form shall be included in the patient&#8217;s medical record.</p><p>If the informed consent discussion has occurred and the patient determines not to consent to the procedure, the consent form shall be placed in the patient&#8217;s medical record with the notation &#8220;Patient refused to sign this document.&#8221;</p><p>Sponsor: Director Date: 8/01</p><h2>Policy 7: Conscious Sedation for Procedures</h2><p>Physicians who are privileged to perform clinical procedures for which conscious sedation is routinely used will be privileged to order and supervise the administration of intravenous conscious sedation as part of the privileging for the procedure.</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>Physician privileged to perform intravenous conscious sedation:<br /> 1. Consider as candidates for the procedure only those patients whose physical status permits pulmonary and cardiovascular stability.<br /> 2. Arrange for the assistance of a qualified individual to intermittently assess the patient&#8217;s ventilatory and vital signs parameters. Ensure the immediate availability of a resuscitation cart, which includes equipment for airway maintenance, temporary ventilatory support, and emergency medication.<br /> 3. Maintain NPO status, dependent upon the sedative used.<br /> 4. At the end of the procedure, determine when to discontinue assessing the patient and release them to home or floor care.<br /> 5. Ensure that outpatients have a responsible adult to take them home and take care of them.<br /> 6. In the patient&#8217;s medical record, document all monitoring results and observations, including when the patient no longer requires monitoring.<br /> 7. If a patient who has received intravenous conscious sedation must be transferred prior to release:<br /> a. Ensure the continuation of not less than pulse oximetry during the transfer; and<br /> b. Transfer only to another setting which can provide the continuing monitoring.<br /> 8. Report mortality and significant morbidity related to conscious sedation at the time of each occurrence consistent with HMPP EC 3.01 Patient Occurrence Reporting.<br /> 9. Report adverse reactions related to the use of conscious sedation through an Adverse Drug Reaction Report form (HMPP TX 2.04) or Patient Occurrence Report (HMPP EC 3.01)</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 8/01</p><h2>Policy 8: Release of Confidential Information</h2><p>It is the policy of the Center for MR Research that confidentiality of all records is maintained I regard to the release of patient/subject, in compliance with the Medical Information Act of 1981 and the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center policies.</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>1.

Patient/Subject Safety<br /> 1. Screening must be completed on all patients/subjects prior to entering the magnet room. The assessment form must be completed and signed. Orbital CT will be required on all subjects who have a history of metal in the eye.<br /> 2. Patient/Subject will be observed at all times while in the magnet.<br /> 3. Patient/Subject shall be properly immobilized while on the MR table.<br /> 4. Proper assistance must be given when transferring the patient from the stretcher or wheelchair for an MR exam.<br /> 5. If there is a reason to believe a patient/subject may be pregnant, she will not be examined before her physician is notified and/or a radiologist consulted and the examination is determined essential to the patient’s care.<br /> 6. Patient/subject should be notified to advise staff of warm or strange sensations while in the magnet.<br /> 7. Patients with aneurysm clips will not be placed in the Center for MR Research scanner until we are in posession of documentaition stating that the aneurysm clip has been tested safe for 3T. The document must include the following information:<br /> a) manufacturer of the clip,<br /> b) make and model,<br /> c) where the surgery was done.<br /> 8. Any subject having magnetic resonance sequences must have hearing protective devices IN PLACE before proceeding with scan.<br /> 9. Staff is required to check under EKG patches and gating devices at patient contact locations at regular intervals throughout the exam on patients sedated or unable to communicate a problem.<br /> 10. Patient exposed regions should not be allowed to come into contact with the bore of the magnet (housing) itself.<br /> 11. All unnecessary/extraneous electrical conductors should be removed from the bore during imaging.<br /> 12. Care should be taken to ensure that no unnecessary loops are made by any electrical conductor in the imaging system. These include such entities as EKG, gating wires, surface coil leads, etc.<br /> 13. The Patient’s/Subject’s skin should not be involved in any electrical conductive loop. EKG lead should be braided around each other to decrease the possibility of forming a large radius loop. However, EKG, surface coil and pulse oximeter cables should not be braided together as this may interfere with monitoring capabilities. These wires should also be kept as far as possible from the walls of the magnet bore.<br /> 14. Thermal insulators (including space/air) should be used between any electrical conductor device and the patient to ensure that the potential for burns from the thermal conductivity from electrical conductors in the imaging system with the patient would be minimized.</p><p>B. Family/Ancillary Staff Safety<br /> 1. Screening must be complete on all visitors prior to him/her entering the magnet room. Should a visitor require medical attention (e.g. x-rays; CT) to comply with our medical screening, then the radiologist must request the testing.</p><p>C. Patient Medical Emergency<br /> 1. All medical emergencies involving patients in the magnet room should observe the following procedures:<br /> a. Check patient status. If the patient is in cardio insufficiency then:<br /> b. Press Stop Scan button on console immediately.<br /> c. Open Scan door. Notify emergency personnel (Call 171. Say “Number One Emergency in MRI Center Room 1A first floor, South tower, 1801 W.

Any reaction requiring a major change in the patients’ management, e.g., hospitalization, prolonged length of hospital stay, or alterations in drug therapy, must be reported. Reactions may include:</p><p>1. Those resulting from an exaggerated, but otherwise usual or expected, pharmacological action of the drug, e.g., hypokalemia-induced dysrhythmias secondary to diuretic therapy administration;<br /> 2. Reactions resulting from an unexpected, aberrant response to the pharmacological action of a drug when given in therapeutic doses, e.g., malignant hyperthermia from anesthesia and many immunologically-mediated reactions; and<br /> 3. Severe reactions resulting from deviations from the established drug therapy regimen, e.g., asystole secondary to rapid intravenous administration of phenytoin and acute renal failure due to elevated vancomycin serum concentrations.</p><p>PROCEDURE<br /> In compliance with the recommendations of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the Center for MR Research maintains a formalized Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Program consistent with the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center policy. This program also reflects the guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for reporting and documenting unusual, serious, or life threatening reactions to drugs.</p><p>The UICMC Pharmacy Quality Assurance Area shall coordinate the Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Program under the auspices of the UICMC Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.</p><p>All health care professionals must report and document any incident in which an adverse drug reaction is suspected.</p><p>A. Any Health Professional Suspecting an ADR must notify a physician-resident and/or attending physician.<br /> B. Physician will assess the nature of the ADR and manage the patient accordingly.<br /> C. Physician, Pharmacist, Nurse or MR Technologist administering medication will &#8211;<br /> 1. Document the ADR in the patient’s medical record.<br /> 2. Complete Adverse Drug Reaction Report Form (see Addendum) and forward it to any pharmacy area. If assistance is needed to complete the form, help is available from a pharmacist.  NOTE: Copies of Adverse Drug Reaction Report Form are available in central pharmacy, all satellite pharmacies, and the Pharmacy Quality the department.

Files removed from the cabinet will be tracked by the Clinical Research Coordinator such that all files may be located at any given time.</p><p>3. A database of all research subjects will be maintained and kept secured by the Clinical Research Coordinator.</p><p>4. None of the source documents will be removed from the Center for MR Research at any time without the written consent of the Director of the Center or the IRB.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 8/01</p><h2>Policy 2: Confidentiality of Research Data</h2><p>The Center for MR Research provides a service for many individual investigators. Since some of these investigators may be involved in similar research, the confidentiality of the individual investigators research data must be secured such that it cannot be used by anyone but the investigator or his/her designates.</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>The Center for MR Research staff will be responsible for moving data from the scanner to other storage devices on completion of the scans performed by the Center for MR Research staff in a timely fashion. The Staff will also be responsible for the security of any data storage media consistent with Good Clinical Practices.</p><p>If the Investigator or his/her designate performs the scan involved in their research, the Investigator or his/her designate is responsible for removing the information from the scanner workstation as soon as the scan is complete. The Center for MR Research will not be responsible for the confidentiality of the information left on the scanner after completion of the study.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 8/01</p><h2>Policy 3: Medical Records: Release of Information</h2><p>The Center for MR Research restricts the release of medical information and medical records. (see HMP IM 4.03 Medical Records: Release of Information).</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>1. All requests for medical information must be in written form and accompanied by a properly executed Release of Medical Information Form signed by the Patient/Subject or their legally-authorized representative specifying the medical records to be released.<br /> 2. No medical information originating outside the Center for MR Research which may be contained in the Center for MR Research files may be released for any reason. The requester should be referred to original source.<br /> 3. If the requested information is contained in the Patient/Subject&#8217;s Medical Record at UICMC, the request and release should be forwarded to the Medical Records Department for response.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 03/02</p><h2>Policy 4: Subject: Internet Protocol (IP) Address</h2><p>It is the policy of the Center for MR Research to secure all Patient/Subject information such that unauthorized access is not possible.</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>An Internet Protocol Address may not be added or given to staff not specifically allowed access to Patient/Subject data as part of their normal duties.</p><p>A non-Center employee may not have an IP address established without the written permission of the Director of the Center. A copy of the authorization with dates will be kept on file by the Network Analyst and Clinical Research Coordinator, responsible for Subject records.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 03/02</p><h2>Policy 5: Creating paradigm files for SCS</h2><p>It is the policy of the Center for MR Research to facilitate the successful utilization of all functional data producing equipment. Consistency in the methodology used to create the data promotes this success.</p><p>PROCEDURE</p><p>1. All paradigms should be movie files, consisting of a series of frames to be played sequentially.<br /> 2. The resolution of the files should be standard VGA, that is, 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high.<br /> 3. All movies should play at 30 frames per second, regardless of the rapidity of motion (or lack thereof) in them.<br /> 4. If color is used, the bit depth should be adjusted to 24 bits, providing 8 bits of resolution each in the red, green and blue channels. For paradigms without color, 2 bit or 8 bit grayscale may be used. Please choose 8 bit if possible, since anti-aliasing cannot be done at 2 bit depth.<br /> 5. Any software can be used to produce the movie files, however, we recommend Adobe Premiere.<br /> 6. If the movie files contain accompanying audio information, the maximum resolution permitted for audio is two channels at 16 bits and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.<br /> 7. Video Signal Encoding: this must be MPEG-2 only. No other encoding methods are acceptable. You may enclose the files in an AVI wrapper, proving that MPEG-2 was used as the encoding method. We recommend the MPEG-2 encoder included with Pinnacle DV500 Plus.<br /> 8. Audio Signal Encoding: this must be mp3 compatible. Variable or constant bit rates may be used, but the data stream should not average more than 64 kbits/s.<br /> 9. We recommend anti-aliasing if motion is present in the paradigm.<br /> 10. Microsoft Media Player is used to play the movie files in the SCS. However, Media Player can use many codecs, which may or may not be installed on our system. The fact that the movie plays in Media Player on your computer is no guarantee that it will play on the SCS. Please test your paradigm on the SCS at least a day or two before using it on a subject.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 8/02</p><h2>Policy 6: The limit for the disk space usage.</h2><p>It is the policy of the Center for MR Research to limit the usage of free disk space on the CMRR Data Server for External Users.</p><p>Procedure</p><p>Every effort is made to provide external users with as much disk space as they require. However, the total amount of disk space will always be limited and investigators should try to use only what is necessary.</p><p>The following quota has been set by the Center for MR Research:</p><p>External user accounts for each investigator: 10 Gigabytes</p><p>If you reach your quota you will not be able to create or extend files.</p><p>Investigators who require a larger quota should contact Ian Atkinson (ian@uic.edu) to request a larger quota.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 10/05</p><h2>Policy 7: Inventory Tracking</h2><p>It is the policy of the Center for MR Research to maintain an inventory of significant items.</p><p>Procedure</p><p>When an item is received it shall be entered into the database. The database is located on the server and the network path is \\128.248.211.3\inventory which can be accessed by typing in the path in your internet browser.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date: 3/06</p><h2>Policy 8: Notification of maintenance to shared computing resources</h2><p>Notification of maintenance to shared computing resources will be made to all affected users prior to performing maintenance.</p><p>Procedure</p><p>1) Notification of planned maintenance that may affect availability of a shared computing resource (e.g., data server, network printer, computing cluster, license server, shared workstation, etc.) will be made to the entire department via email at least 48 hours prior to beginning maintenance. This notification will be repeated 1 hour before beginning maintenance. The notification will describe the maintenance to be performed, the need for the maintenance, the expected time to complete the maintenance, and the availability of the computing resource during maintenance.</p><p>2) Notification of unplanned (emergency) maintenance that may affect availability of a shared computing resource (e.g., data server, network printer, computing cluster, license server, shared workstation, etc.) will be made to the entire department via email at least 10 minutes prior to performing maintenance. The notification will describe the maintenance to be performed, the need for the maintenance, the expected time to complete the maintenance, and the availability of the computing resource during maintenance. If data availability will be affected, a verbal notification will also be made to the entire department to minimize the risk of data loss.</p><p>Sponsor: Director<br /> Date:
