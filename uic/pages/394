        The Science Learning Center (SLC, room 201 in the Science
        and Engineering South building, SES) is a place in which
        all levels of expertise meet and exchange ideas. It is home
        to the sciences: biology, chemistry, earth and
        environmental science and physics. Students can obtain
        tutoring in many of the 100-level science courses from
        graduate teaching assistants who keep regular office hours
        each week as well as from student tutors who have recently
        excelled in those classes. Students may also find their
        teacher in the Center as many of them use the open,
        friendly spaces available in the center for their office
        hours. The Center is a great place to meet friends to go
        over homework problems and to study for exams. The Science
        Learning Center also contains computers for general use as
        well as a formal computer lab that is overseen by the
        Academic Computing and Communications Center (ACCC), and an
        ACCC consultant is available to assist computer users at
        all times. In addition, inside the Science Learning Center
        is a UIC office of WISE, the Women in Science and
        Engineering Program..

        "font:13px 'Lucida Grande', LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif;">Dr. Clark and the staff at the SLC are committed to providing a welcoming environment to all students.  In accordance with the University of Illinois non-discrimination  policy, we are committed to the most fundamental principles of academic  freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity.   All decisions are based on individual merit and are free from invidious discrimination in all its forms.  We will not engage in discrimination or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran and will comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders and regulations.  Dr. Clark is a participant in the <a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/quic/gsc/">Safe Zone</a> program at UIC that creates and supports allies for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning communities.<br />
        <br />
        The Science Learning Center is also home to peer-led study
        groups that focus on the sciences. Student-leaders, who are
        trained in group dynamics and problem solving techniques,
        have expertise in a particular subject area. Generally the
        peer-leaders are members of the UIC Honor’s College who
        have successfully completed these courses. Peer-leaders
        guide their students toward development of sound study
        skills by encouraging them to work together to solve
        problems. In this manner students contribute to the
        solution of a problem even as they learn techniques and
        skills from their peers. The goal of the peer-led study
        groups is to assist students to develop individual study
        strategies tailored to the demands of a specific
        discipline.

        The SLC is closed evenings, weekends and school holidays.
        <br />
        <br />
        TA office hours and professor office hours are scheduled at
        the start of each semester, although a request to reserve a
        time in one of the study areas may be made at any time
        during the semester for open times/rooms. The SLC may also
        be used for departmental activities such as holiday
        parties. All queries regarding the use of the SLC should be
        directed to Dr. Clark (see bottom of page for an email
        link) except for queries regarding scheduling of the
        computer lab inside the SLC - these should be directed to
        the ACCC.</span><span style=
