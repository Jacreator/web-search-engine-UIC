<p>Back in high school, there were different cliques from the jocks to the nerds and from the loners to those who often did “recreational fun.” I fell somewhere in between, not really fitting in any single group, but befriending enough people from each group that I was still known. I was seen as the nice girl, the smart girl, the innocent girl, but all of these titles never truly defined me; these were just the generalizations given to anybody without any standout characteristics. In a way, they were right; I was the type of student who always strove to get As, who always abided by the rules, who didn’t go out to party because of studies, and who was quiet enough not to be memorable. In high school, I didn’t see the need to fit in and have a clique to call my own; I had a few special friends who I could truly express myself with, and I had my alone time to cherish. These things were enough for me back then, but after entering college, I realized that I wanted to experience more things, to live a life outside of academics and the clubs that I merely joined to look good on a college application. I wanted to free myself enough to finally start enjoying life instead of waiting to enjoy life in the future.</p>
<p>By some crazy, unplanned move, I summoned up the courage to ask a stranger out. This was uncharacteristic of the girl no one really paid attention to, who has always been labeled as the nice, shy one. Well, overall, the date probably went okay to outsiders, but to the girl who always over-analyzes a situation, the date went horribly.</p>
<p>Let’s call this guy Jeffrey. Jeffrey was three years older than me, and the stories he talked feverishly about demonstrated how much more experienced he was than me. He had so many interests to talk about from his passion about becoming a cop one day to his obsession with sports and dancing, and finally, to his dreams of one day backpacking alone in a foreign country. I loved hearing him talk about his stories; they were passionate and well-phrased, demonstrating his comfort in socializing.</p>
<p>But then came the question that I feared the most: “So what do you do for fun?” My brain stopped working, and I honestly didn’t know what to say. I stammered out a few things that I wasn’t actually passionate about, and finally, I just said the first thing that came to mind, “I don’t really have the time to do much but study.” At that moment, I perpetuated the Asian stereotype, and I felt so ashamed (I mean this guy was Asian too, but at least he was the interesting type who did more than study). At that moment, the date went downhill, and there was some uncomfortable stammering and a few awkward silences. I just wanted to crawl into a hole but instead, I kept reverting the questions back at him to ignore the fact that I was not as interesting as him. Let’s just say, at the end of the date, when he drove me home, I messaged him, and I have yet to receive a reply back.</p>
<p>So, you ask, “What’s the point of this cringey, overdrawn story?” Well, besides wanting to reflect on a horrible date that I just came back from, I wanted to share my experience with those of you who have never gone on a date or who have also had a “cringey” first date experience.</p>
<p>Despite me saying that it was an awful first date, I honestly don’t regret it at all. It got me out of my comfort zone and forced me to see that asking someone out, especially a guy, isn’t as terrifying as it seems. Sure, they might say no, and sure, the date may not go as smoothly as you hoped for, but there will be more dates to go on with a newfound courage that is released when you finally make that move. So maybe, on the second, third, fourth, or even fifth date I go on, I’ll finally have the right words to say that paint me in a light that truly reflects who I am.</p>

		<p><img class=" wp-image-1409 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="353" srcset="https://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-330x220.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was not prepared, emotionally, for the events at Charlottesville. I did not expect the effects that it would have on me, as a self-proclaimed Afro-centric person. I expected that, should I ever see white men march through the streets shouting racist rhetoric, I would immediately be filled with rage, ready to strike back against them. To push them back into whichever dark and musty little corners of life that they came from. Instead, all I could do was walk away from the television, lie down in my bed and cry. No matter how I tried, I couldn’t grasp how one could feel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much hatred towards one person, let alone entire groups of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, I thought that I had fortified myself against feeling that kind of pain as a result of prejudice and discrimination. It’s not as if my family and I haven’t been called the N- word before by people with racist intent (excluding the cases of people ignorantly using the word in a disappointing mimicry of Black culture). It’s not as if I have not witnessed my younger cousins being watched and followed around stores. It’s not as if my family and I have not been kicked out of places of business, not because we were loud or causing an inconvenience, but simply because of the color of our skin. So why was I so upset? Shouldn’t I be used to this by now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought that I had fortified myself because during high school, I made it my mission to learn about my people’s history, including the atrocities committed against the stolen humans of this country. It’s not like I had not seen the footage of people marching and singing “We Shall Overcome”, while trying to avoid shots of water that must have felt more like fire and the bites of barely-constrained canines. It’s not like I had not read about the horrors that occurred on the plantation. It’s not as if I had not seen the images of men recently lynched and/or burned by mobs dressed all in white. So why was I so upset, when I had already seen so many of the grotesque images that colored the history of African Americans in this country? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What bothered me the most, as I lay in my bed, was not the fact that these wastes of supposedly human flesh had actually marched through the streets with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiki torches (</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of all things</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t unsee the look on my father&#8217;s face (yes, father). He had been around to see the Civil Rights Movement. He had been just a year older than Emmett Till, when Till had been murdered. He had grown up hearing stories about slavery from his grandfather. He had grown up hearing about the time his grandfather had almost been lynched because his grandmother just so happened to be white passing. Recently, we were talking about what was happening in this world today, and all he could say was, “Nothing makes sense anymore.” And he’s right, nothing makes sense at all. So what’s my point? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My point is, we need to do better. Period. We need to take a look at what we casually say and do around one another and around the ears of younger individuals. We need to take a look at what people write off as “just joking,” because jokes often have some truth to them. We need to take a look at the idea of political correctness, not as an irritating reinforcement of modern social norms, but perhaps as a way of bettering ourselves as a society. As a way to move forward toward a better future, rather than remaining stagnant and/or possibly regressing back to the uglier times in this nation’s history. </span></p>

<p>One of the main reasons I chose to attend UIC was that UIC is a very research-intensive university. Research was something that I have always wanted to do since I was in high school, so attending UIC was the perfect choice. As an undergraduate, I believe that there are many benefits of conducting research. Undergraduate research allows students to develop their critical thinking skills such as problem-solving and observation, enhance their creativity, and build professional connections with other students and faculty. In addition, undergraduate research looks awesome on a resume when looking for jobs after graduation.</p>
<p>After searching for almost a year, I finally found a research position that I am genuinely interested in. While looking through the abstracts from the 2016 Student Research Forum, one particular student’s research really caught my eye, so I decided to send a quick email to the principal investigator. After about a week, I got a response that the team did indeed need help over the summer, so after I lot of contemplation I decided to join. I will be conducting research in the College of Nursing that aims to understand the relationship between hepcidin and iron metabolism and the maternal and birth outcomes associated with hepcidin. Hepcidin is a newly identified key regulator in iron homeostasis. It blocks gastrointestinal absorption of iron, immensely lowering the amount of iron available to both fetus and mother during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Initially, I will only be undergoing training over the summer to recruit and screen patients who may be eligible for the study. After the training period, I will be taking additional responsibilities such as maternal and fetal blood processing in addition to screening and recruiting. I am most interested in learning about impacts on fetal neurocognitive development due to low levels of maternal iron. My goal is to conduct an independent capstone project based on the research study by my senior year and present it at a research forum.</p>
<p>Even though I am a little nervous to start the research position, I am so thankful to have been given the opportunity by UIC and am also really excited to gain outside of classroom experience. Since I will be getting plenty of interactions with patients, I will be more prepared to pursue my career goal of becoming a gynecological oncologist in the future.</p>

<p>The Honors College offers various opportunities for students to get involved in student publications, including The Ampersand, OneWorld, Red Shoes Review, and The Journal for Pre-Health Affiliated Students.</p>
<p>The Ampersand is the official newsletter of the Honors College that highlights Honors College events, faculty, and students. The goal of the publication is to inform students and faculty about Honors College events, such as the Honors College Ball and the HCAB Faculty-Student Luncheon. Interested students can get involved in blogging and photography opportunities as well. Blog topics have ranged from highlighting Honors Core courses to cultural experiences as a college student. Students do not need to have any writing experience to be involved and can email <a href="uicampersand@gmail.com">uicampersand@gmail.com</a> with questions.</p>
<p>OneWorld features articles that address socioeconomic issues, world events, and study abroad experiences. The overarching goal of the publication is to inform the UIC community of events transpiring around the world and serve as a platform for student voices on global issues. Editors diligently work with writers throughout the year to publish a high-quality journal. This year’s issue includes features on Ilham Tohti, a scholar imprisoned for human rights activism, and the destruction of cultural heritage sites by ISIS and other militants. Interested students can reach out to <a href="mailto:oneworld.uic@gmail.com">oneworld.uic@gmail.com</a> for updates.</p>
<p>The Red Shoes Review is the Honors College undergraduate literary and arts magazine. It is published once each year. Red Shoes Review members arrange events to fundraise and increase student engagement by having fun and celebrating creativity. During the first semester, members host open mic events, plan for the magazine, and collect pieces. In the second semester, they fundraise through an art show, create the magazine with the pieces they&#8217;ve chosen, and publish and distribute the publication during their Quad Day event. Interested students can email <a href="mailto:uic.redshoes@ gmail.com">uic.redshoes@ gmail.com</a> and like them on Facebook via UIC&#8217;s Red Shoes Review.</p>
<p>The Journal of Pre-Health Affiliated Students, or JPHAS, is a publication that focuses on health topics such as the latest health research findings and recent health news. It serves as a forum for pre-health students to write and read about interesting advancements in health. This year’s issue highlights advances in epigenetics research and the ethical concerns of assistive reproductive technologies. Interested writers can also email <a href="mailto:jphas.journal@gmail.com">jphas.journal@gmail.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The Honors College not only emphasizes academic excellence but also offers leadership opportunities through journalism to enhance students’ experiences on campus.</p>

<p>Given the highly competitive nature of the Access Path to Psychology and Law (AP) program, only five awards are distributed nationally every year. This year, two recipients, Kaitlynn Richardson and Brandon Garcia, are Honors College students and currently work in the lab of Honors College Dean Emerita Dr. Bette Bottoms. The AP program aims to diversify the fields of psychology and law by encouraging faculty members to recruit underrepresented graduate school applicants in their research labs. The program provides financial support for the recipients to garner research experience and opportunities for mentoring and professional development.</p>
<p>Kaitlynn Richardson, a sophomore majoring in psychology and biological sciences, was recruited by Bottoms and applied to the AP program because it intersected with her interest in psychology as a pre-med student. Richardson has been working in Bottoms’ lab, where she has learned common research methods in psychology, such as coding transcripts and data entry. Through the AP program, Richardson hopes to complete her Capstone project, which will examine the correlation between race and animal abuse.

<p>Brandon Garcia, a first-generation college junior majoring in psychology and criminology, law, and justice, was also recruited by Bottoms and applied to the AP program. Garcia hopes to use the AP grant to fund an ongoing study in the lab regarding juries and their reaction to animal abuse. Working alongside Richardson for an average of 10 hours a week, Garcia’s tasks involve data collection and analyses.</p>
<p>Garcia and Richardson both attended the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) national conference in Seattle in March. Both students plan to use their time in the AP program to develop their Capstone projects. Students interested in developing and implementing their research projects in psychology or law can apply for the AP program by December 2017.</p>

<p>Liz Stark, a current senior majoring in the Teaching of Mathematics Secondary Education, was this year’s recipient. Stark’s goal after graduation is to work for Chicago Public Schools as a high school math teacher and ultimately teach at her alma mater, Lane Tech High School. Stark is not only an exceptional student, but also has been an active member in many Honors College organizations, such as the Honors College Ambassadors, the student representative for the Honors Council, and the Honors College Student Leadership Council. Stark was also a member of the Honors College Advisory Board for three years, where she served as the Freshman Representative, Secretary, and President.</p>
<p>When asked about her favorite Honors activity, Stark mentions that joining HCAB during freshman year and eventually serving as President of the organization was a truly memorable experience. As President, she was able to “fundraise for scholarships, organize the Honors College Ball, and plan student social events throughout the year.” The leadership roles Stark has taken on during her time in the Honors College “helped [her] become more organized, creative, and collaborative.” Stark hopes to utilize the skills she has gained in her future career as a math teacher. Stark values her relationships with Honors College students, staff, and professors, and appreciates that the Honors community provided her “a small liberal arts college environment inside a large research university.” The Honors College congratulates Stark once again for her accomplishments!</p>

<p>Sarita Deshpande, an Honors College senior majoring in bioengineering, has been named a Gates Cambridge Scholar. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship was established by Bill and Melinda Gates as a $210 million endowment in order to enable exceptional students to complete a postgraduate degree at the University of Cambridge in the UK. Sarita will be pursuing an MPhil in Medical Sciences at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences for a year.</p>
<p>As a bioengineering major, Deshpande has research experience in modeling physiological cell and tissue interactions in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and in the Department of Bioengineering where she conducts image processing and segmentation of optical coherence tomography angiography images. She participated in the Clinical Immersion Program through UIC’s Department of Bioengineering, which allowed her to explore the close relationship between bioengineering and medicine by conducting needs assessments and identifying medical device problems in the healthcare setting. She also serves as the editor-in-chief of the Ampersand and the UIC Bioengineering Student Journal.</p>
<p>At Cambridge, Deshpande will be studying mechanisms of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucomatous models, which can provide insight into the development of novel therapeutic options. Deshpande is “humbled and honored to have received this opportunity and to be a part of such a diverse and dynamic group of scholars,” and she is excited to join the vibrant community of Gates Cambridge Scholars as she takes the next step in her education.</p>

<p>A large component of the traditional college experience stems from residential life. Campus housing provides a space for students to make new friends and experience a connectedness to the university. Such an example is James Stukel Towers (JST), where a large portion of Honors students live in an Honors Special Interest Area located in the C-Tower. Throughout JST, there are students who work as Peer Mentors to help residents, particularly academically, as they transition to UIC and to campus housing.</p>
<p>Mohan Chennakesavalu, a sophomore major– ing in biological sciences, currently works as a Peer Mentor in JST. I recently sat down with Chennakesavalu to discuss his experiences as a Peer Mentor in Honors housing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Describe the role of a Peer Mentor in housing. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> In a sense, we’re kind of like academic RAs. We work with freshmen from the day they move in and learn what classes they’re taking, what their majors are, and future goals. We keep tabs on them throughout the year and get alerts during midterms if they’re not doing well. If they are doing well, we help them connect with resources such as research or scholarship opportunities. We tutor three hours a week at JST. We’re there to help residents transition to college and to ensure their academic success and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What has been your most memorable experience this year as a PM?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> I loved move-in day. Getting to know residents from the beginning, when no one was around, and going on trips with them during New Student Days was a lot of fun. That’s when they come in and they don’t have any work to do, so you actually get to know them before the stress kicks in.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What makes Honors housing a special environment in contrast to other Special Interest Areas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> What’s nice is that there are a lot of freshmen and sophomores who are all in the same classes. On my floors, the residents are in the same Honors Core and they’re all taking calculus, so they always work together. In other towers, you may have that, but it’s a lot more variable. As a PM in the Honors tower, we do Honors programming, so one thing we’re working on is having faculty who teach Honors Core classes come and have dinner with Honors students in the dining hall. As a community, we’re very collaborative and welcoming. Being surrounded by people who are like you and the programming really distinguish Honors housing from the rest of the SIAs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you choose to become a PM?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s a great leadership experience, and you meet a lot of people. I have 60 residents and 30 freshmen, and I know all of their names and talk to half of them regularly. And working at the front desk, you constantly see people in and out, four hours a week. You get to develop a lot of relationships, which is definitely rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So you’re finishing up your first year as a PM. What has been the biggest lesson you’ve learned?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s important to form relationships with residents at the beginning of the year. If you don’t reach them at the beginning, then they don’t know who you are, and if you check in with them later, it’ll be awkward. [It’s all about] putting yourself out there and not being afraid to talk to new people. At first, it’s definitely a transition, but it’s probably the most important part.</p>
<p>There is also an Honors Special Interest Area in Commons West. For more information on Honors housing visit www.honors.uic.edu/housing.</p>

<p>When Dr. Nancy Cirillo began teaching her Honors Core course last fall, Readings in the Atlantic Slave Trade, she “hadn’t dreamed of” the collaborative class project that would emerge from it. Honors Core courses are meant to enrich and broaden foundational critical thinking skills that prepare Honors College students for the rest of their educational careers. Cirillo’s discussion based class focuses on reading, evaluating, and analyzing primary sources to gain a greater understanding of the long–lasting impact of slavery in contemporary American society. The creation of the course was inspired by three rare collections that focus on the Atlantic Slave Trade housed at UIC’s Daley Library. Primary sources such as these are key to understanding and analyzing history. Unfortunately, they are often missing in high school education. The class from the fall of 2016 was a particularly memorable class for Cirillo. The students were especially passionate during one post-presidential debate class discussion, where they could not help but link current events to their readings. Cirillo was “both delighted and astounded by the thoughtfulness of their comments and the passions with which they spoke of the issues.” She was able to see the intricate web that connects the devaluation of debate in high school to the lack of the kind of critical thinking that emerges from examining and consuming primary sources.

<p>The class from the fall of 2016 was a particularly memorable class for Cirillo. The students were especially passionate during one post-presidential debate class discussion, where they could not help but link current events to their readings. Cirillo was “both delighted and astounded by the thoughtfulness of their comments and the passions with which they spoke of the issues.” She was able to see the intricate web that connects the devaluation of debate in high school to the lack of the kind of critical thinking that emerges from examining and consuming primary sources. These primary sources are truly key to understanding and analyzing the immense impact of significant parts of history such as slavery, which was another component missing in high school education. She proposed that for their third essay assignment, students “could write their case for the teaching of evidence-based, analytic history in high school instead of their original assignment,” a prompt for which every student chose to construct an argument.</p>
<p>Cirillo took different quotes and excerpts from the students’ essays, as well as her own thoughts, and composed an article about this collaborative class project. One of the quotes Cirillo included from her student, “Why am I only learning about this now?” was a familiar sentiment expressed by the class as a whole. “These first semester freshmen [expressed] emotions that [ran] from disappointment to rage that they were lied to and infantilized in their AP history courses,” she recalls. She, joined by the voices of her students, argues eloquently for a broader inclusion and discussion of slavery and its immense impact on America in the high school curriculum. Through the essay, and through teaching her class, Cirillo also wants to demonstrate that “the value of the liberal arts lies in its capacity to train the mind largely through critical thinking to negotiate complex interrelated and often ambiguous areas.” The essay has been accepted for publication at UIC. Hopefully, it will be able to enact a concrete change in how the topic of slavery is taught in high school while impressing upon readers the importance of a facts-based liberal arts education.</p>

<p>As a freshman, I was overwhelmed by the idea of research and felt intimidated by all the successful professors. With encouragement and support from the Honors College, I was inspired to give research a try. I am a biological sciences major on a pre-dental track, so I was looking for a lab that fit my interests. I applied for open research positions through the Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) and waited for responses. I was discouraged when I did not receive any offers, so I decided to email professors directly. I received interviews for several labs, but none of the labs felt like a good fit for me. I was looking for a long-term research commitment, so I carefully thought about which lab fit my interests and career goals. I find that I am the most productive when I am passionate about what I am doing. It took me until the middle of my sophomore year to find the best lab.</p>
<p>I currently work with Dr. David Reed at the UIC College of Dentistry, studying how chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions regulate homeostasis in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This is important for the study of osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness from cartilage breakdown.</p>
<p>My project aims to compare the ECM interactions of the cartilage in the TMJ to the cartilage in the knee in a mouse model. In order to evaluate these interactions, I visualize tissue through staining techniques and obtain images via confocal and fluorescence microscopy. I will be presenting a poster at the Clinic and Research Day at the College of Dentistry and at the UIC Student Research Forum.</p>
<p>The 10+ hours I spend per week conducting research are filled with valuable lessons; I always learn something new from Dr. Reed and my peers. I have had the privilege to meet and work with some of the most influential students and professors at UIC, all while reinforcing my passion for dentistry.</p>
