<p>This summer, the Honors College and the Latin American and Latino Studies program are jointly sponsoring a new three-week program to the Chiapas region in Mexico led by Dr. Joel Palka, an anthropology professor and national expert in Mesoamerican history and culture. Since Palka’s first visit to Chiapas as an undergraduate student himself, he has returned to the area five times a year in the past three decades.</p>
<p>Chiapas is one of the most beautiful places in the world, known for its indigenous cultures and remarkable biodiversity that rivals even that of the Amazon rainforest. As Palka explained, the Lacandon Maya settled in this Southern Mexico region thousands of years ago, building marketplace infrastructure and religious shrines that remain culturally preserved today. The surrounding jungles of cedar and mahogany trees consumed the temples of Palenque when Maya presence declined, but the ruins have since been restored into a famous archeological site containing some of the finest architecture, sculptures, and relief carvings of Maya culture.</p>
<p>This study abroad experience is a great opportunity to develop an Honors Capstone project while receiving course credit for it. Jessica Santillan, a senior at UIC, is currently working with Palka on her Capstone project, eagerly planning on returning to Chiapas through the summer program following her first trip to the region. Her research focuses on studying two unique Maya urns, one of which is located in a museum in the historic neighborhood of San Cristóbal. She collected samples to compare with the second urn, located in Michigan, and is currently working to determine the similar deity represented on both urns and find affiliated images for further examination. Other Capstone projects could also focus on researching indigenous art or health and dietary topics at the markets, including comparing indigenous markets with traditional supermarkets, researching medicinal herbs and medicines used by the Lacandon Maya, or examining local food networks.</p>
<p>Palka will lead studies observing the centurieold Maya outdoor marketplaces where local vendors display colorful textiles, intricate woodwork and pottery. The students will explore photographic archives, interact with the local indigenous population, visit anthropology museums in San Cristóbal, and explore excavation sites. In addition to the three credits of Independent Study Research (3 credits HON 401 Advanced seminar for Honors College students), the Introduction to Mexican History and Culture course will be held in cooperation with the Mexico Solidarity Network at the Autonomous University of Social Movements (AUSM), which will transfer for three additional credits at UIC. Food and housing are provided, with the dorm rooms located within the AUSM building. For Honors College students, a discounted price is provided. No Spanish proficiency is required— only an interest in Mexico’s history and culture.</p>
<p>To all students interested in pursuing a study abroad experience, this program offers a plethora of opportunities for a historical and vibrant adventure in Chiapas. The Chiapas program takes place this June. For more infromation, please contact Dr. Palka at jpalka@uic.edu.</p>

<p>Maria Folvarska, a senior majoring in history and math and computer science, was awarded the U.S. State Department Critical Languages Scholarship (CLS), which sponsored her study of the Russian language at the KORA Russian Language Center in Vladimir, Russia during the summer. The program offers students an enriching experience that introduces them to the culture, language, grammar, and literature of another country. The scholarship also aims to strengthen and build relationships between the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>Folvarska has always been intrigued by the Russian language and its cultural roots. She studied the Russian language for two years at UIC and dreamt of an opportunity to study in Russia. Folvarska&#8217;s Honors 101 instructor Beth Powers, the Director of the Office of Special Scholarship Programs, suggested the CLS program, to which Folvarska applied and was accepted to study in Russia.</p>
<p>The CLS program sends students to small towns where English speakers are scarce, which helps students learn the language and immerse themselves in every aspect of the country’s culture from a local perspective. Folvarska visited parts of old Russia, including former capitals from medieval times, which allowed her to experience other unique aspects of Russian culture, such as songs and poems. Folvarska describes visiting the Volga River, the longest river in Europe, as one of her most memorable experiences. She also found that she was able to form strong relationships and beautiful memories with her host family. She remembers visiting her host family’s dacha, or summer home garden, where she was able to spend time with her host family’s dog, Rikki, and pick berries. Folvarska also enjoyed watching Russian shows on television with her host mother.</p>
<p>These experiences have left Folvarska even more curious about Russian culture and language, and she plans to either attend graduate school to study Eastern European or Russian history or begin an internship with the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. Opportunities abound in the Honors College for students to study abroad and learn about foreign languages and cultures. Folvarska encourages others interested in foreign languages to look into the CLS program and apply confidently.</p>

<p>Where does a passionate, budding law student go to further his interest in the field? For UIC senior Sachin Patel, the perfect place was Amsterdam, Holland. Patel—a dual degree student in history and biological sciences who plans to attend law school—decided to study abroad after his sister spoke highly of her experience. He chose to particiate in the IES Amsterdam Law &amp; Criminology program from August 16 to December 18, 2015.</p>
<p>Patel lived in a dorm designated for both Dutch and international students located in a southern neighborhood of the city called Uilenstede. He enrolled at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where he took three international law courses and a Dutch history course. His favorite class was a course that compared Dutch and American law, highlighting differences in the “legal culture” around the world.</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, Patel explored the city, which he described as “incredibly picturesque.” He observed “flowers, boats, and beautifully built homes” alongside canals circling the city. Patel and his friends took full advantage of the public events in the city. From traditional cheese markets to EDM concerts, there was always something fun to do. He explored the Anne Frank House museum, a classical orchestra performance, and several art markets. One memorable experience was when he and his friends got lost and turned a 25 minute bike excursion into a three hour ride! Though the bulk of his study abroad semester was spent in Amsterdam, Patel also visited other European cities such as Munich, Barcelona, and Antwerp.</p>
<p>Patel’s study abroad experience left a lasting impression on him. He acknowledged that it’s important for students—often too busy with jobs and schoolwork—to be open to attending different events, whether in Chicago or abroad. Patel urges other students who are thinking about studying abroad to “just do it.” He left the Netherlands with a diverse group of lifelong friends, and his interactions have taught him how to represent himself, how to learn outside the classroom, and how to be more independent but aware of the world around him. Patel raved, “It is, hands down, the best experience of my life.”</p>

<div id="attachment_1065" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1065" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-3.06.39-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 3.06.39 PM" width="225" height="206" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ariunaa Bayanjargal in Denmark</p></div>
<p>“Leave a little room to live!” Ariunaa Bayanjargal—a senior pre-med biological sciences major—declared this mantra as she recounted her study abroad adventures in Denmark last year. Through the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, this Honors student traveled to Denmark and explored the medical field’s broad expanses—interacting with physicians from numerous specialties, investigating medical practices and policies, and taking a variety of classes to explore the nuances of medicine.</p>
<p>Originally from Mongolia, Bayanjargal knew she wanted to study abroad in college. Luckily, she discovered the UIC Study Abroad Office and discovered the Medical Practice and Policy program after a few visits. The program’s 180 courses, including Immunology and Biology of Marine Mammals, piqued her interest. The fact that she would be able to spend an entire semester in Europe and fulfill her biology major requirements also appealed to Bayanjargal and served as a crucial factor in her decision to go to Denmark.</p>
<p>Bayanjargal stayed in Denmark’s capital, Copenhagen, with a host family. Alongside 900 other students, Bayanjargal was able to explore her interest in medicine through the Medical Practice and Policy program’s many activities. Students engaged in courses such as Human Health and Disease and journeyed across Europe to further learn about the multifaceted nature of medicine. Bayanjargal’s excursions around the country allowed her to hear firsthand about Denmark’s health care system from a family practitioner and provided her and her classmates with the opportunity to learn about how vascular surgeries are done. Her class also visited Sweden and Estonia. In Sweden, she witnessed an ACL surgery and visited the Karolinska Institute, home of the committee for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. These study tours capture a fraction of the many visits that Bayanjargal and her classmates made. Upon the culmination of these trips, Bayanjargal gained new perspectives regarding healthcare and healthcare practices in Northern Europe, as compared to those in the US and Mongolia.</p>
<p>In addition, Bayanjargal’s courses—specifically “The Complexity of Cancer”—were integral to her study abroad experience. The two oncologists that led the class captured her attention by their differing perspectives on cancer. One specialized in end of life palliative care and presented the clinical aspects of patient care, while the other—who is pursuing her PhD—emphasized the art of learning. They sparked an interest in her to explore cancer’s scope in medicine.</p>
<p>Her experience in Denmark has certainly refined her career plans. Although Bayanjargal knew that she wanted to pursue an MD/PhD and had worked on retinal cell research in a UIC lab for the past few years, she wasn’t quite sure what she wanted to do beyond that. Exposure to cancer’s complexity in her class, however, blossomed into a desire to pursue cancer research.</p>
<p>Living in Denmark provided her with the opportunity to discover what she wanted to do. Bayanjargal stated, “[Study abroad] has been an excellent way to learn about what I really like.” She strongly recommends study abroad for anyone who is interested, as it provides a great opportunity to live a little and learn more about themselves.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Final Days of Immersion</strong></h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-819 size-large" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cave.jpg" alt="cave" width="665" height="373" /></p>
<p>Living in China has taught me an important thing: great things happen outside my comfort zone. If it weren’t for the language barrier, I would have not practiced my ability to think critically and listen carefully. My favorite part about this trip was adjusting to Mandarin. Whether it was practicing a simple conversation when buying my favorite spicy potatoes at a stand or just saying hi, I felt very proud being able to communicate. Six weeks ago, I flew into China feeling timid and confused about the language. Today I return to Chicago with a sense of confidence and accomplishment. Although I have a long way to go to become fluent, I now have a strong foundation of Mandarin and hope to continue learning the language at UIC.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-820" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/acupuncture-150x150.png" alt="acupuncture" width="150" height="150" />During our second half of the program, we learned about three important inventions used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and practiced them with the help of doctors of Yunnan TCM hospital. The first invention we learned about was acupuncture. Acupuncture works by inserting needles on specific points in our body for therapeutic purposes. These points are on the meridians of our body and are connected to our organs. According to TCM, they stimulate the energy flow throughout our body (known as <em>qi</em>).</p>
<p>Another invention we learned about was moxibustion. Moxibustion functions to promote blood <img class="alignright wp-image-821 size-thumbnail" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/moxibustion-on-my-legs-2.jpg" alt="moxibustion on my legs 2" width="150" height="150" />circulation. It also works to nourish <em>yang qi</em> which is what “charges the battery” for our bodies when we are fatigued. It also warms the channels that connect our organs and expels pathogenic cold. Moxibustion can be done in three ways: with a moxa stick, moxa cone, or acupuncture needle. A moxa stick is a stick made of dried Artemisia Vulgaris, a kind of plant. The stick is ignited on one end and then placed over the affected or diseased part of the body. This is direct moxibustion. With direct moxibustion, no padding is used,  so there is a chance that the burning may scar the patient. Indirect moxibustion can also be done with moxa cones. The moxa cone is ignited and insulates the skin by being placed on a pad. Pads can be made of ginger, garlic, or salt, and different pads are used for treating different conditions.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-822" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cupping-2.jpg" alt="cupping 2" width="150" height="150" />The last invention we learned about was cupping. The science behind it is very interesting. Cupping works by warming up points and channels of the body to release toxins and rid the body of diseases. Cupping is done by applying a jar to the body.  Air is expelled with heat to create a vacuum inside the jar to produce suction on the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wrapped up our classes by taking our final exam on community health and traditional Chinese medicine as well as the Mandarin written and oral exam. I believe I got an A on both because I received a 103% on my TCM final and I felt very confident about the Mandarin oral exam! I really enjoyed studying this summer because I was very interested in the material about medicine and loved practicing the language whenever I could .</p>
<p>My biggest question from the start was how Western medicine and TCM work together. This was answered during the last few days in many different ways. After a summer of learning, I believe that TCM works best for preservation of health and prevention of diseases. On the other hand, Western medicine may be preferred once a disease has developed into a severe state, such as cancer. TCM has taught me to think outside the box through its diagnostic methods, which involve looking at the patient as a whole and examining other factors such as nature.</p>
<p>Our last week in Kunming was very exciting. We visited a women and children’s hospital and<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-823" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/stone-forest-2.jpg" alt="stone forest 2" width="300" height="168" /> learned about healthcare for pregnant women. Then we visited Naigu Stone Forest, which is exactly what it sounds like! About 260 million years ago, the area was uplifted due to tectonic movement. The stones look amazing and reach extremely tall heights with the highest point at an altitude of 1,870 meters. We also visited an amazing cave system in Juixiang with rivers flowing through them. We concluded the weekend with a karaoke night with faculty and a farewell dinner with delicious food, where completion certificates were distributed!.</p>
<p>However my trip wasn’t over the moment I left Kunming. On the way back home, I had a 15-hour layover in Hong Kong, and I actually had an amazing time! I checked in at the Regal Airport Hotel and got on the Mass Transit Railway and arrived to the Kowloon area in just 20 minutes. From there I took a taxi to Temple Street Night Market where all of the souvenirs shops are located late at night. There was plenty of food, numerous shops, and many foreigners. Almost everyone spoke English. At the end of the night, I was glad I didn’t let my fear of getting lost and missing my flight get in my way. Instead, I was confident in my navigation abilities and made the most of my time! In less than three hours, I learned how to navigate with the MTR and taxi system. I wished I had more time so I could have explored other areas. I have never felt so independent in my life!</p>
<p>Thanks to the Gilman International Scholarship, I was able to have these experiences. I hope to come back to China in the near future to study more Chinese and explore other cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Stay tuned for my next trip!</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Two New Languages: Mandarin and TCM</strong></h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-810" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/TCM-diagnosing.jpg" alt="TCM diagnosing" width="260" height="300" /></p>
<p>Ni hao! Hello again from China! I am halfway through my “Community Health and Traditional Chinese Medicine” study abroad program and every moment has been full of learning experiences. I feel like this program has really brought out a new side of me. I feel a sense of independence and I’m learning to embrace changes in my life, even adjusting to the new language.</p>
<p>Mandarin is intriguing and I have been making great progress. Very often, at a restaurant, I’ll ask in Mandarin where the restroom is even though I already know, because I’m eager for every opportunity to practice the language. I’ve even been thinking about taking a Chinese course at UIC when I return. The language is just one aspect of this whole experience that I enjoy.</p>
<p>Another intriguing thing is the different medical approach that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors take with their patients. TCM doctors rely on four diagnostic methods to examine disease and collect data from different angles. The four diagnostic methods include inspecting the outward body, listening and using olfactory senses, asking questions, and taking pulse. While diagnosing, doctors also take into account the theory of five elements—which are wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—because these elements each correspond to specific organs and abstract relations.</p>
<p>After studying the relationship between these elements and taking the midterm exam, I was able to understand how, for example, fire corresponds to the heart, works with the small intestine, and is associated with joy. The heart is yin and the small intestine is yang, and the two parts work together. The five elements theory highlights the relationship between different emotions, tastes, and health conditions. Understanding the relationship and associations of the organs helps TCM doctors diagnose patients and recommend the appropriate treatment. The doctor can then prescribe the appropriate TCM medicine, or some TCM doctors choose to prescribe Western medicine as well. If the disease isn’t in a severe state, then herbal medicine can also be prescribed. We were able to see a TCM doctor diagnose a patient and see this process in action. Also, a TCM doctor even used these four diagnostic methods to diagnose us individually—it was intriguing! Thankfully, the TCM doctor said I was healthy.</p>
<p>One important TCM treatment I have really enjoyed learning and practicing is massaging, which is closely related to acupuncture. The concept behind the massaging techniques is to put pressure on certain pressure points in our body because these points are on meridians and can provide therapeutic effects when stimulated. These meridians are connected to the organs and the correct amount of applied pressure helps the flow of blood and <em>“qi.” </em>In TCM, <em>qi</em> is regarded as the supernatural force that exists in human beings and the universe, and it is what gives us life and helps move our blood. We observed a TCM doctor massage one of my friends, and then we practiced on each other as he explained the relationship of the pressure points and the conditions that they treat. We also received a rice bag to practice massaging techniques on our own. Later on during the week, we saw a blind woman explain her career in massaging and techniques. Her determination was very inspirational! Her English was also exceptional. Listening to her story was proof to me that anything is possible.</p>
<p>What I took from this understanding of TCM is that one should never focus on just one side of the problem. Be curious. Be open-minded. Things aren’t always what they seem to be and one must understand the overall picture first.</p>
<p>Up next on my trip is a field trip to various rural and urban parts of Yunnan, a southwest province in China. We are staying in hotels at different cities for eight days and learning about the culture and medicine while exploring and having fun. In my previous travels, my favorite cities so far have been Dali and Lijiang because they are urban and full of stores, interesting people, and entertainment. It makes it easy to engage with the Chinese culture. There is honestly so much to write about each of these places that I could probably write a book about it! But in the meantime, you can stay tuned for more updates from me about my time in China summer on the <em>Ampersand </em>blog!</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Journey To Neverland…So I Could Grow Up</strong></h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-750" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_0914.jpg" alt="IMG_0914" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>I am an actress. I have love for my craft and all that it encompasses. I have a passion for it, and it is this passion that fuels my desire to learn and take in as much as I can about it. My specialty is character work. I can create characters based on what I hear, what I see, what I feel, and what I experience&#8230;and often I also draw from what I haven’t heard, what I can’t see, what I don’t feel, and what I haven’t experienced.</p>
<p>You can imagine my excitement when I arrived in the theatre capital of the world – London, England – for a year-long international adventure with no familiar surroundings. The inspiration for new characters rushed through me like a river, but what excited me the most was the opportunity to practice. The opportunity to pull out a character and be someone different for a year. Acting at its finest, I thought. After all, no one in London knew who I was, where I’d come from, or what my past held. I was presented with the perfect opportunity to do what I do best. I could’ve been anyone I wanted to be. To my surprise, the character I chose wasn’t grand or eccentric. There was nothing particularly special about this character, nor was it one of my favourites. She was indeed quite unfamiliar, even to myself. She was me.</p>
<p>The experience was and remains indescribable. The best I can do is to tell you that living in London is unmatched by any experience I&#8217;ve had in my life thus far. I was surrounded by history and culture, simply because I lived in London, but it was also much more than that. I felt more like myself than I had in a while. I was definitely home.</p>
<p>My theatre classes were marvelous and theatre in London is untouched by any I&#8217;ve seen or experienced. I experienced the theatre industry as a black actress in the UK and was introduced to the colour-blind casting process. It’s amazing to know that I’ve studied theatre in a place where I could quite literally be whatever or whoever I chose without a thought for my colour and with every thought towards my talent.</p>
<p>The friends that I made are amazing and I have no doubt that we will continue to be friends in the years to come. We saw a different play together every week, and we performed together extremely well.  I taught them all how to play Samurai—an improvisation game—and my theatre professor has continued to use it with her students even after I left. We inspired each other with our love for theatre, and in doing so, we awakened passions for life that we didn&#8217;t know that we had. I was very much free to be me without my masks and my voices, and even though I used them and I still created them, I was beginning to like the voice that I was blessed with a lot more.</p>
<p>I find myself thinking about how I used to feel. I&#8217;ve never wanted to grow up. I think that&#8217;s part of why I love theatre so much—the sense of play. And while I&#8217;m still addicted to that sense of play, I have changed. I have grown. I am different, and I like it. Funny really, that I traveled to the land of Neverland to grow up.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hej! A Study Aboard in Denmark</strong></h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-743" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Kari-Xiao-Copenhagen.png" alt="Kari Xiao Copenhagen" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>My name is Kari Xiao. This summer, I am graduating from UIC and the Honors College and moving on to attend the UIC College of Medicine in the fall. Last summer, I studied abroad in Copenhagen. Before I go deeper into my study abroad experience, let me emphasize that I had no intention of studying abroad at all when I was a freshman. However, due to having a good work ethic at UIC and encouragement from staff members, friends, and family, I was able to spend this Spring semester in Denmark!</p>
<p>I am in the Medical Practice and Policy program of the larger Danish Institute for Study Abroad (DIS). This program is great for students interested in continuing their area of interest—be that health, architecture, psychology, photography, business, or others—while wanting to explore all things Danish. In addition to human health and public health classes, I am also taking a class on Hans Christian Andersen and body, gender, and culture. The electives here range from those as astonishing as pornography in Scandinavia to more hands-on ones like marine biology labs.</p>
<p>The most exciting aspect of my study abroad opportunity has been the many opportunities to not only study in Denmark, but all around Europe. DIS includes three travel breaks, one of which is mandatory and must be done with your program.  However, for the other travel breaks, I was free to travel to Italy, Prague, Austria, Hungary, and basically anywhere in Europe. However, while traveling has brought exciting new adventures, there also has not been a boring day in Denmark due to my amazing host family. It’s heartwarming to see how some people can open their home and hearts to a complete stranger with different food preferences, lifestyle habits, and attitudes on life. You can’t imagine how easy it is to break language barriers when you’re forced to live in the same house for four months!</p>
<p>From all the experiences that came from inside the classroom and wandering the streets of Budapest, the most important lesson I learned was how to appreciate. Getting lost in Rome taught me that hand gestures are universal and that (most) people have essentially good intentions. Soaking in the Copenhagen sunlight after a month of clouds and winds stronger than those around University Hall taught me to appreciate the pleasures of the moment. (Yes, sunlight is that fleeting in Denmark!)  Sitting through Danish-styles lectures taught me that the Danes do education right: to enjoy a topic, discuss it!</p>
<p>So as you prepare to begin your time at UIC, don’t forget about all the exciting opportunities that await you outside the edges of campus too!  If you’re interested in studying abroad, don’t let financial matters deter you, because the Study Abroad Office has been extremely helpful with financial assistance. If you would like to talk more about studying abroad, I’d love to chat with you.  You can find me around Burnham Hall next year!</p>
<p>Hej hej,</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Traveling a Road of Tradition</strong></h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-736" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Carlos-Blog-Picture-3-kunming-view-2.jpg" alt="Carlos Blog Picture 3 - kunming view 2" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p>Ni hao! Hello from China! I have only been living in Kunming, the great “City of Eternal Spring,” for a few days, but it has been an incredibly engaging experience so far. It has been both exciting and a little overwhelming to live away from home and completely immerse myself in Chinese culture, language and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This summer, I am studying in Kunming through a study abroad program with SIT (the School of International Study). My six-week program is called “Community Health and Traditional Chinese Medicine.” In addition to learning basic Mandarin, we are also learning about community health and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), both topics that interest me greatly as an aspiring physician. Our course will cover public health issues by working with professionals in the field in both urban and rural settings.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-735" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Carlos-Blog-Picture-1-lake.jpg" alt="Carlos Blog Picture 1 - lake" width="150" height="150" />We have classes at the 12-story Yunnan traditional medicine hospital in Kunming. A traditional medicine hospital is unlike typical Western hospitals because of the different approach the doctors use to treat patients. A concept that is central to TCM is the idea that every element has a complementary, opposite element that balances it (e.g. hot and cold). This relates to the balance between yin and yang, and maintaining this is important because an imbalance may cause diseases.</p>
<p>In class, we are currently learning about acupuncture, which is one approach used to treat patients in TCM. The visual demonstrations and lectures in the classroom are taught by a TCM doctor. Acupuncture helps restore balance by stimulating specific points of the body to prevent illness or cure disease. Back in Chicago, I used to peek into patient rooms out of curiosity when I volunteered at Rush University Medical Center. This time, when I peeked into one of the rooms of the TCM hospital, I was surprised to see patients lying in their beds with needles stuck in their face and body.  I later found out that I had seen some patients that were being treated with acupuncture for facial paralysis, a common health problem in the area.</p>
<p>My favorite part so far has been learning Mandarin in the classroom and trying to use it when going out to eat with my group!  Mandarin is a difficult language, but the more I study it, the more I am intrigued by it. It is sophisticated and forces English speakers to think outside the norm. The reason<img class="alignright wp-image-734 size-thumbnail" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Carlos-Blog-Pictuer-2-kunming-view.jpg" alt="Carlos Blog Pictuer 2 - kunming view" width="150" height="150" /> it is sophisticated is because I must avoid my natural instincts honed from the English grammar and realize that my common sense won’t help me understand the language. The way syllables are put together to create words involves a different kind of logic. Also the ways syllables are pronounced is very important since some may be spelled the same but mean different things depending on what intonation they take. When I am not in class, I spend my time exploring the city and looking for new places to try food or hang out to do homework. It’s challenging for me because I’m not fluent in Mandarin, whereas some of the other students in the program have had prior experience studying the language.  I struggle with ordering my food, but I am slowly learning the basics as I attend my Mandarin classes. I use the word “xiè xie” (which translates to “thank you”) over and over because right now it is what I am most comfortable saying!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have Mandarin class, a lecture on HIV/ AIDS prevention, and a lecture about diagnosis and causes of disease. I’m excited! Stay tuned for more updates from me about my summer in China on the <em>Ampersand </em>blog!</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Captivated by Copenhagen: Learning about happiness in one of the happiest countries in the world!</b></h1>
<p><b></b>The start of this summer brought an incredibly exciting adventure for me: the ultimate three-week summer study abroad experience in Copenhagen, Denmark! Prior to departing, I had heard so many beautiful stories about how study abroad experiences can be life-changing. Even so, I did not understand how profoundly I would be affected by just three weeks in Copenhagen.  Three experiences in particular highlight how I learned how to embrace the true meaning of happiness.</p>
<p><b>1. The Happy Wall: Reliving the Days of Free Creativity</b></p>
<div id="attachment_725" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-725 " src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maria-Blog-photo-1.jpg" alt="Maria Blog photo 1" width="150" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sharing some UIC love at the Happy Wall!</p></div>
<p>Remember when you were a child and you were given a blank sheet of paper to color on? I would pick the brightest shade of Crayola crayon that I could find and scribble to my heart’s content. At that moment, nothing made me happier than seeing my colorful drawing come to life. Well, the Danes believe so strongly in creative expression through art that they designate public spaces for just that. I stumbled upon one of these spots after class one day. Located at the end of a popular commercial street in Copenhagen where it attracts many passersby, the Happy Wall is a 12-foot wooden wall that is covered from top to bottom in wooden flaps. The outside of each of the flaps is painted in black and the inside of each flap is vibrantly painted in a different color of the rainbow. Many people come throughout the day and arrange the flaps in different designs. Some use it to proclaim their love for one another while others draw flowers or personal slogans. Feeling overcome with happiness and school pride that day, I felt like sharing some UIC love with the rest of Copenhagen!</p>
<p><b>2. Positive Psychology: Happiness in the Classroom</b></p>

<p>Before departing for Copenhagen, I heard that Denmark has been consistently ranked as one of the happiest countries in the world. Thus, I decided to take a course on “positive psychology,” which is a branch of psychology rooted in theories and empirical evidence about how to promote happiness and well-being by focusing on positive traits and aspects of a person’s life. What could be better than learning about happiness in one of the happiest countries in the world? It was indeed the most fulfilling class that I have ever taken! Together with our professor, who we called by her first name Line, we performed a walking meditation in King’s Garden, visited a place devoted to relaxation called the Mindful House, and engaged in cross-fit training to learn about the positive effects of exercise on drug rehabilitation through a local program called the Sports Project. Not only did I learn how to live a happier, healthier lifestyle through our discussions in the classroom, but I also was able to apply what I learned in a variety of settings around Copenhagen! No wonder the Danes are so happy!</p>
<p><b>3. Happiness &amp; The True Meaning of Friendship</b></p>

<p><b></b>I’ve often heard the phrase “success is meaningless unless you have someone to share it with.” I find it to be true, since my study abroad experience would not have been the same without the company of my new travel buddies and friends. My Positive Psychology classmates were brave enough to bare their fears of living in an unfamiliar country so far away from home for the first time as well as share their excitement to explore this new place. It was so comforting to be surrounded by people who were also experiencing the same emotions as I was. I learned a great deal about communication and genuine support from everyone that I met. My heart was so full by the end of the three weeks and I came home ready to share all that I had learned with my family, friends, and others at UIC.</p>
