<p>A large component of the traditional college experience stems from residential life. Campus housing provides a space for students to make new friends and experience a connectedness to the university. Such an example is James Stukel Towers (JST), where a large portion of Honors students live in an Honors Special Interest Area located in the C-Tower. Throughout JST, there are students who work as Peer Mentors to help residents, particularly academically, as they transition to UIC and to campus housing.</p>
<p>Mohan Chennakesavalu, a sophomore major– ing in biological sciences, currently works as a Peer Mentor in JST. I recently sat down with Chennakesavalu to discuss his experiences as a Peer Mentor in Honors housing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Describe the role of a Peer Mentor in housing. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> In a sense, we’re kind of like academic RAs. We work with freshmen from the day they move in and learn what classes they’re taking, what their majors are, and future goals. We keep tabs on them throughout the year and get alerts during midterms if they’re not doing well. If they are doing well, we help them connect with resources such as research or scholarship opportunities. We tutor three hours a week at JST. We’re there to help residents transition to college and to ensure their academic success and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What has been your most memorable experience this year as a PM?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> I loved move-in day. Getting to know residents from the beginning, when no one was around, and going on trips with them during New Student Days was a lot of fun. That’s when they come in and they don’t have any work to do, so you actually get to know them before the stress kicks in.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What makes Honors housing a special environment in contrast to other Special Interest Areas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> What’s nice is that there are a lot of freshmen and sophomores who are all in the same classes. On my floors, the residents are in the same Honors Core and they’re all taking calculus, so they always work together. In other towers, you may have that, but it’s a lot more variable. As a PM in the Honors tower, we do Honors programming, so one thing we’re working on is having faculty who teach Honors Core classes come and have dinner with Honors students in the dining hall. As a community, we’re very collaborative and welcoming. Being surrounded by people who are like you and the programming really distinguish Honors housing from the rest of the SIAs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you choose to become a PM?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s a great leadership experience, and you meet a lot of people. I have 60 residents and 30 freshmen, and I know all of their names and talk to half of them regularly. And working at the front desk, you constantly see people in and out, four hours a week. You get to develop a lot of relationships, which is definitely rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So you’re finishing up your first year as a PM. What has been the biggest lesson you’ve learned?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s important to form relationships with residents at the beginning of the year. If you don’t reach them at the beginning, then they don’t know who you are, and if you check in with them later, it’ll be awkward. [It’s all about] putting yourself out there and not being afraid to talk to new people. At first, it’s definitely a transition, but it’s probably the most important part.</p>
<p>There is also an Honors Special Interest Area in Commons West. For more information on Honors housing visit www.honors.uic.edu/housing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Yuwa Edomwande, an Honors College junior majoring in biological sciences, began her semester by joining the Trade Winds and Conversation Partners programs of the Office of International Services. The Trade Winds program pairs international students with US students to engage in one-on-one and group activities throughout the semester, promoting crosscultural exchange. The Conversation Partners program engages US students and international students in conversation to not only exchange English and foreign language skills, but also foster cultural awareness.</p>
<p>Edomwande has always been intrigued by Mandarin Chinese and China’s cultural roots. After studying abroad in Beijing and enrolling in Chinese language courses throughout high school and college, she was motivated to join the Trade Winds and Conversation Partners programs. These provide flexible schedules, which include fun, interactive events throughout the semester. In exchange, students commit to meeting their partners five times during the semester and reflecting on their experiences in journals or blogs. The Trade Winds program began with a kickoff event that challenged students to find their partners based on similar interests. Edomwande and her partner bonded over the card game Uno, and after talking, realized they shared a lot of common interests. Conversation Partners met in a small group setting, through which Edomwande interacted with her partner and other students participating in the program.</p>
<p>Both programs encourage students to learn new languages and immerse themselves in cross-cultural experiences. Edomwande professes, “We’re all similar in more ways than we are different,” and encourages students to learn about foreign languages and cultures by taking advantage of the unique opportunities the programs offer.</p>

<p>The Honors College hosts numerous events throughout the school year for students to get connected with each other, advisors, and faculty. One of those events is the Student-Faculty Luncheon that occurs once each semester. It’s the perfect opportunity for students to not only eat great food from places like Roti and Qdoba, but also begin building a network for themselves while getting to know the faculty of the Honors College. I went to the luncheon during the fall and spring of my freshman year with a few friends. Each time, I made great connections with professors, advisors, and even the Dean of the Honors College. Even though I couldn’t talk for long, it was nice to talk with the Dean about how the semester was going and to greet some of my advisors. One of the best parts was getting to talk to my professor outside of the classroom. We discussed the latest superhero movies, and how they reflected past events in US history and the progression of society. It was a little awkward at first seeing my professor outside of class, but</p>

<p>One of the best parts was getting to talk to my professor outside of the classroom. We discussed the latest superhero movies, and how they reflected past events in US history and the progression of society. It was a little awkward at first seeing my professor outside of class, but the feelings quickly passed once we started talking. It was an opportunity for the professor to get to know me better as an individual and for me to get to know my professor outside of the classroom. The luncheon was the beginning of a long-term relationship with my professor who later wrote me a letter of recommendation.</p>
<p>I encourage all Honors College students to go to the luncheon because it’s a great opportunity for networking and getting to know professors and Faculty Fellows. Also, who doesn’t like good food?</p>

<p>“What makes a competitive graduate school applicant?” Professor Ralph Keen, Interim Dean of the Honors College and Professor of History, provided insight to this question in the October 20th Honors College Fall Professional Development Series event “Applying to Graduate School in the Humanities.” Dean Keen began by laying out the pros and cons of pursuing graduate study and then dove into the logistics of the application process, strongly suggesting that students enter it “as a researcher.” He advised applicants to take initiative to find the right graduate program that fits their needs, as well as the faculty member whose work engages them the most. “Be bold” and “contact professors beforehand to demonstrate an interest in their program,” Dean Keen pointed out. It’s important for an applicant to get a sense of how well he or she will collaborate with the faculty.</p>
<p>In the application itself, there are typically four main components: the writing sample, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and GRE scores/transcript. According to Dean Keen, the writing sample is considered the most important because that is where the applicant’s creativity, ideas, and “quality of mind” are evaluated; it is the “audition for the program.” Attendee Rucha Shah, a junior majoring in sociology, said, “Dean Keen was quite thorough and was able to share many personal experiences about the application process. His advice can be beneficial to any applicant to graduate school in the humanities.”</p>

<p>Honors College students who are in need of financial assistance will have a new resource thanks to a $1 million donation from the CME Group Foundation. This is the largest gift the Honors College has received in its history. Over the next four years, $900,000 will support scholarships for students pursuing finance-related fields, and another $100,000 will be put toward the Honors College Dean’s Emergency Fund.</p>
<p>First established in 2008, the CME Group Foundation was created with the purpose of supporting education by partnering with K–12 school districts, universities, charter networks, and nonprofit organizations to assist disadvantaged students. On the university level, the CME Group Foundation specifically aims to prepare students for careers in financial services and risk management.</p>
<p>The bulk of the funds will be given as scholarships to students majoring in business and finance-related fields. These awards are intended to assist students whose financial aid packages do not cover the full cost of tuition,especially low-income and first-generation college students from Chicago Public Schools.</p>
<p>The CME Group also donated $25,000 yearly for the purpose of ensuring the continued success of one of the Honors College’s most important scholarships, the Dean’s Emergency Fund, which helps pay educational expenses of Honors College students of any major who find themselves in emergency situations or with unforeseen expenses. Generally, a student in need can receive up to $2,000 in assistance so that he or she can continue to pursue an undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, students in need of financial assistance will not be the only ones to see the benefits of this partnership. The relationship between the Honors College and the CME Group Foundation will also bring the potential for internships and other collaborations in the financial sector. In the coming semesters, many Honors College students will undoubtedly benefit from this unprecedented donation and the opportunities it will bring.</p>

<h1><strong>A Tutor’s Perspective</strong></h1>
<address><em>by Alvin George &#8211; Sophomore, Biochemistry </em></address>
</div>
<p>One of the most effective ways to learn material is to teach the concepts to someone else.The tutoring program offered by the Honors College not only allows me to serve UIC students,but it also furthers my own understanding of the subjects I tutor. Honors College tutoring is a walk-in, one-on-one tutoring program that can assist students of all majors who are seeking resources on a wide variety of subjects.</p>
<p>Having tutored in high school, I chose to continue tutoring throughout college to consistently refresh my understanding of course material and to force myself to exercise higher levels of analysis. For example, tutors will certainly encounter students who do not understand concepts the first time around. As a tutor, the most exciting part of the experience is finding ways to tailor my explanation to the student’s needs. In general, I try to quickly understand the tutee’s learning style before continuing on with the tutoring session. This allows me to create effective approaches— such as using analogies, asking the students to repeat my explanation in their own words, or devising similar practice problems. Ultimately, the most rewarding part of tutoring is the positive influence it can have on a student’s success.</p>
<p>Although formal office hours are invaluable, asking a professor or even a TA for help can be daunting. Getting extra assistance from a fellow student who has gone through the same course makes the experience more relatable. This commonality definitely contributes to making the material easier to grasp.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unique feature of the Honors College tutoring program is that students get to tutor in almost any subject. Tutors like myself serve three hours a week and are Honors College students who have earned a B or higher at UIC in the classes that they’re tutoring. Our work can be used to fulfill the Honors Activity requirement each semester.</p>

<h1><strong>A Tutee’s Perspective</strong></h1>
<div>
<address><em>by Sagar Dommaraju, Freshman, Mathematics     </em></address>
</div>
<div>
<p>Sometimes your organic chemistry professor can explain how a molecule’s structure can be used to determine its pKa value six times but it just doesn’t sink in. In such cases, turning to a peer who has learned the material more recently and can explain it in a different way can be a good resource. That’s what the Honors College tutoring program is all about.</p>
<p>Last week, I decided to visit the Honors College tutors on the second floor of Burnham Hall. I was hesitant at first because there were so many other things I could have done with a Friday afternoon, but it definitely paid off. As soon as I entered the room, I was met by three enthusiastic tutors who introduced themselves as Mark, Natalie and Hina. Tutoring is available in all subjects, but I was happy to find three biology or chemistry majors to help me with organic chemistry. It turns out that Natalie had taken the class the year before; she and Mark decided to help me while Hina worked with another student who was there.</p>
<p>Their explanations were extremely helpful. When I had a question about what we were covering— such as how an ester and a methyl group might affect pKa differently—they answered patiently. If I asked a question to which they didn’t immediately know the answer, they pulled out a textbook, got out their notes, or directed me to sources online—anything and everything that would help me understand the concept better. The one-on-one attention is a great supplement to visiting a professor in the typical office hours setting. I am sure I will be seeing a lot more of Mark, Natalie, and Hina by the time this semester is over.</p>

<p>Honors College students are masters of the balancing act. It’s often hard to find time to unwind between midterms, exams, social lives, and homework. However, what better way to relax than spending some quality time with an adorable cat? Honors College Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Hui- Ching Chang, the Faculty in Residence for C Tower in James Stukel Towers (JST),<br />
can help you there!</p>
<div>
<p>Every Thursday, Dean Chang opens her apartment in JST and invites students to come in to relax, talk about their week, and play with her delightful cat, Cutie. A striped little cat, Cutie is friendly and playful with every student who comes to these office hours. “I have always wanted a cat,” Dean Chang says about her new pet, which she got about four months ago. “He’s adjusted to the apartment very well.”</p>
<p>These office hours with Cutie allow students to gain insight from faculty members in a relaxed environment. Dean Chang also invites faculty from all disciplines: “I think it’s really important that [students] get to know professors from outside their majors,” she explained. “And, of course, Cutie’s right in the middle of it!”</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of spending some one-on-one time with Dean Chang and Cutie, which gave me the opportunity to see that the friendly little cat was indeed part of a bigger picture. As Dean Chang showed me many snapshots of Cutie engaging with the dozens of students that come visit, I realized how much she cares about her students. Dean Chang is not only invested in helping students sort out their majors and classes, she is also genuinely interested in their lives outside of academics. When students come in to play with Cutie, Dean Chang takes the opportunity to get to know them personally. Every student who comes into her apartment is welcomed with open arms, to stay for ten minutes or an hour and a half, to learn something, talk to someone, or just take a break. No matter what, everyone leaves with a smile.</p>
<p>So come in at 8 p.m. on Thursday in JST and play with Cutie! He sure lives up to his name!</p>
