    <a name="a" id="a"></a><span class="clsSubHead">Introduction</span></p>
    <p>The College of Engineering offers degree programs in 
    engineering  and computer science. These degree programs prepare men and women for  one or more of the many career opportunities in the engineering or  computer science professions, such as  those in design, production, research, development, management, or  sales. An engineering or computer science education also prepares a  student for further study in medicine, law, business administration,  and other areas.</p>
<p>Instruction in the  college is complemented by intensive research activity by most of the  faculty. Research is directed toward supporting the educational  programs of the college, solving contemporary technological problems,  and extending the frontiers of scientific knowledge. This continuing  research activity helps to ensure the integrity and progressive  evolution of instructional programs at all levels. In conjunction with  their teaching and research, many of the faculty also engage in public service activities in the community and in government on the local, state, and federal levels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="b" id="b"></a>Mission of the College</span><br />
</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">The mission of the College of Engineering at  the University of Illinois at Chicago is to provide the opportunity for  each student to become all that he or she is capable of becoming  through excellence in education in the three areas of teaching,  research, and service. In the area of  teaching, the college provides academic excellence to its students  through ten Bachelor of Science programs in six departments:  Bioengineering; Chemical Engineering; Civil  and Materials Engineering; Computer Science; Electrical and Computer  Engineering; and Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. With the  changing dynamics of society, the college continues to strive for  excellence and innovation in both its instructional and research  programs. In the area of community service and as part of the  University&rsquo;s Great Cities Program related to economic development and  environmental concerns, the college is continuously strengthening ties with the industrial community, especially the dynamic region of Illinois.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="c" id="c"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Undergraduate Study in Engineering</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A primary goal of the UIC College of Engineering is to ensure that its students are well prepared for:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Practice in the engineering profession; </li>
      <li>Continued formal education at the graduate level; and </li>
      <li>Continued education to adapt to evolving 
      technologies and changing markets. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>College  faculty and administration are continually reevaluating and revising  curricula so that engineering and computer science degree programs  consistently incorporate the changes that are occurring in technology  and society. </p>
    <p>The college attracts  students and faculty who represent a broad spectrum of nationalities,  cultures, races, ages, and genders. Diversity is also reflected in the  number and types of employment opportunities available to students.  Area corporate partnerships support co-op and internship experiences  that are tailored to individual student needs.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="d" id="d"></a>Educational Objectives</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">The UIC College of Engineering offers  undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to join faculty in  cutting-edge research. In the classroom, students become familiar with  the fundamental mathematical and scientific principles that are common  to engineering and computer science disciplines, and they learn to  apply these principles to current engineering and computer science  problems of analysis, design, and experimentation. Through individual  and group projects, students make use of current techniques,  instruments, equipment, and computers, and gain proficiency in  communicating the results of their work. Study in other disciplines  provides students with an understanding of the professional ethical  responsibilities of practicing engineers. Students also have the  opportunity to participate in a number of the many on-campus student  chapters of national engineering professional organizations as a way to  supplement their classroom experiences.</p>
<p>In  the first two years, each student will be required to complete courses  in mathematics, chemistry and physics (or other science requirements,  for computer science majors), and University Writing. Beginning in the  second year, the student will start course work in a particular major  that represents the technical phase of the student&rsquo;s academic career  and constitutes a cohesive program of advanced work in a chosen field.  Although the course work in the major becomes progressively specialized  in the junior and senior years, each student is also required to take  engineering or computer science courses outside of his or her chosen  field.</p>
    <p>A student must also complete  course work in the general fields of humanities and social sciences.  Because engineers and computer scientists are no longer narrow  specialists, they must recognize the effects of their work on the  general welfare of society. The humanities/social sciences phase of  their education helps them to become serious contributors to the  quality of life. Requirements for the degrees often include free  electives that introduce flexibility into the curricula.                </p>

    </p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3">Course Work Limitations<br />
    </span>For the degree of Bachelor of Science, a  minimum of 128 semester hours acceptable to the College of Engineering  is required for graduation. (See individual majors for the specific  hours required for graduation.) </p>
    <p>Course  work that duplicates previous credit does not count toward graduation;  no credit is given for a course in which a failing grade is received.</p>
    <p>Credit  earned in English 050, 060, 070 or 071  does not count  toward graduation in the college, except in the following way: students  may earn 3 semester hours of credit in English 070 or 071 and a waiver  of English 160 for the term in which they receive written authorization  from the Department of English.</p>
    <p>Credit  for graduation is not given by the College of Engineering for courses  numbered below Chemistry 112, Physics 141, and Mathematics 180; such  preparatory courses cannot be used as nonmajor electives or free  electives.</p>
    <p>All courses will be used when  determining a student&rsquo;s full-time or part-time status; for computing  grade point averages (except for 000-level courses); and in determining  probation, dismissal, and Dean&rsquo;s List statuses. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Free Elective Credit</span><br />
    Students in some majors must complete 1&ndash;6  credit hours in free elective courses to reach 128 hours required for  engineering degrees. These hours are in addition to specific types of  elective groups (humanities, social science, non-major-rubric,  additional math, technical, or area electives). These free elective  courses may be technical or nontechnical, but remedial or duplicative  courses are not allowed. A maximum of 2 semester hours of free elective  credit in kinesiology is allowed. Programs that have such free  electives are chemical engineering, computer science, and engineering  management.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3"><br />
  Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">In order to receive a degree from the  College of Engineering, a student must present a minimum grade point  average of 2.00/4.00 in all work in the major. In addition, the student  must satisfy the University requirement of a 2.00/4.00 grade point  average in two categories: (1) all work taken at UIC; (2) all work  taken at UIC and all other two- and four-year institutions combined.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students declare their intent to graduate online using <em>my.UIC</em>.  The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of  the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of  the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request  at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will  be made following the close of the term. If a student has  satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student&rsquo;s  name will be placed on the official degree list.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Enrollment Residence Requirement</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Either the first 90 or the last 30 semester  hours of degree work must be completed in continuous, uninterrupted  enrollment residence at UIC. In addition, at least one-half of the  credit hours required in the student&rsquo;s major area of study must be  completed at UIC. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois  at Chicago and another collegiate institution or enrollment during the  summer at another institution, when approved by the student&rsquo;s college,  does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for  graduation. Work taken at the Urbana-Champaign or Springfield campuses  of the University of Illinois cannot be used to satisfy this  requirement. Credit earned through proficiency examinations, including  credit earned through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), UIC  extension courses, and Urbana-Champaign correspondence courses does not  apply toward nor interrupt the enrollment residence requirement.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Credit Limitations </span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">The College of Engineering requires that of  the 128 semester hours needed for the degree, at least 60 semester  hours after attaining junior standing must be taken at UIC or another  accredited four-year institution; the university enrollment residence  requirement (see above) must also be satisfied. For most transfer  students, these requirements mean that additional transfer credits from  junior (or community) colleges are severely restricted or not permitted.</p>
<p>Upper-division  (300- and 400-level) courses in ABET-accredited engineering or computer  science majors can be transferred only from other ABET-accredited  engineering or computer science programs. This limits transfer of  credits from junior colleges, U.S. vocational or technology programs,  and overseas programs to lower-division (100- and 200-level) courses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All transferable courses must have a grade of C or better in order to be considered for credit toward a degree in the College of Engineering.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Credit for Continuing Students</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Continuing students planning to take non-UIC courses must get prior approval from the College of Engineering. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0;">During the fall and spring semesters, a  full-time program is 12 to 18 semester hours. More than 18 semester  hours is considered an overload and students must seek approval by  filing a petition in 123 SEO. For Summer Session 1 (Four-Week) and  Summer Session 2 (Eight-Week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6  semester hours as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time  enrollment. Students seeking to take more than 9 semester hours during  the summer should file a petition in 123 SEO.</p>

    <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li> Any student whose UIC cumulative grade point average falls below  2.00/4.00 is placed on 2.25 academic probation. A student on 2.25  probation is required to earn at least one B and no grade less than a C  in each ensuing term until both the UIC cumulative grade point average  and the total cumulative grade point average are above 2.00/4.00. </li>
      <li> Any student whose grade point average for any term falls below  2.00/4.00 but whose UIC cumulative grade point average is above 2.00  will be placed on 2.00 academic probation for the following term. The  student will return to clear status if a grade point average of at  least 2.00 is earned without any grade less than C in the following  term. </li>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Dismissal Rules</span></p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li> A student on academic probation who does not meet the probationary requirements will be dismissed from the University. </li>
      <li> A student who fails to make progress toward a degree may be dismissed.  Examples of failure to make progress include excessive term deficit  points,<span class="sup">a</span> failure to complete required courses, accumulation of  excessive number of Incomplete (I) grades, failure to earn credit in  any semester, and failure to maintain a 2.00 average in the major  discipline.</li>
      <li> A student may be  readmitted after the first dismissal with petition and presentation of  above-satisfactory performance in college-level courses taken outside  of UIC.

    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Undergraduate students may drop courses  using <em>my.UIC</em> through the end of the second week of  classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer  Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3  through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2),  students may drop courses with the permission of their major college.  If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will  be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3  through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2),  a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a  maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on  their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program.  College of Engineering students must submit a Late Drop Petition Form  to the COE Front Office, 123 SEO. </p>
<p>A  student who wishes to drop all courses must withdraw from the  University by completing a special form and submitting it to the  College Office, 123 SEO, by the end of the last business day before  final examinations. The grades of W for all courses in the term  withdrawn do not count towards the maximum of four allowed late course  drops. Student can register normally in the next term.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="n" id="n"></a>Changes within a Major</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Changes within degree programs are handled  through petitions. A General Engineering Petition or Petition for  Modification of Major is required when a student wishes to change  contents of a major. Petitions often require long lead-times for  processing and the College Office, 123 SEO, should be contacted for  specific instructions. If approved, the student is sent a notification  by mail or fax.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="o" id="o"></a>Class Attendance</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">In case of excessive absences, the course  instructor may recommend to the college that a student be dropped from  the course. Adverse consequences of such involuntary course drop must  be weighed against high probability of failure in the course. Moreover,  such involuntary course drops must be within the framework of four  allowable late course drops by sixth week in fall or spring (between  the third Wednesday of Summer Session 1 and fifth Friday of Summer  Session 2).</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="p" id="p"></a>Course Prerequisites</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Some departments verify whether students  have listed prerequisites and may drop students who cannot provide  satisfactory proof of having completed the prerequisites by first or  second week of the term. In other instances, it is students&rsquo; responsibility to ensure that they have the listed prerequisites. It is  difficult to perform satisfactorily in most engineering courses without  having the listed prerequisites.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="qq" id="qq"></a>Credit/No Credit Option</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Certain types of courses may be taken on the  credit/no credit option in the College of Engineering. In this option,  a student will be allowed to complete a limited number of courses with  a grade of credit (CR) or no credit (NC) instead of a letter grade.  Courses below the 200-level, required courses, and essential  prerequisite courses cannot be taken as credit/no credit. For detailed  information on the college&rsquo;s policy on credit/no credit, the student  should inquire in 123 SEO. </p>
<p>Students  must apply at their college office no later than the tenth day of the  term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer  Session 2) to have a course designated for credit/no credit grading  option.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="r" id="r"></a>Declaring a Major</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">All students entering the College of  Engineering must declare a major in order to be assigned a departmental  faculty advisor after the first term. Students must declare their  majors at the time of entry to the college or by the end of their first  term. Students can petition to change their major by completing a form  in the college office, but the petition will not be approved if the  intended major is oversubscribed and thus closed.</p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="r" id="r2"></a>Double Major, Double Degrees, and Second Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree </span><br />

    <p style="margin-top: 0;">This option is not available in the College of Engineering.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Double Degrees</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>Double  degrees are possible for some College of Engineering students who want  to pursue two bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in Engineering concurrently. Students  must complete a minimum of 30 additional hours of 300- and 400-level  course work for the second engineering degree. Combination of degrees  that have substantial overlap is not allowed. Interested students  should speak with an advisor and submit a petition to College of  Engineering Office, 123 SEO. Double degrees with another college are  not permitted.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Second Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students  who have already earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree must apply and be admitted  as an undergraduate to the College of Engineering in order to pursue a  second bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Students must complete all requirements for  the second degree as specified by the college and the major department,  including a minimum of 30 additional hours of 300- and 400-level course  work beyond those required for the first degree. The UIC enrollment  residence requirement must also be met, i.e., the last 30 semester  hours for second degree must be taken at UIC. Combination of degrees  that have substantial overlap is not allowed.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="s" id="s"></a>Graduate-Level Courses for
      Undergraduate Credit</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Many 400-level courses are part of required  or elective courses. Students need special permission from the college  to take 500-level courses.</p>

    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students with nontransferable college-level  credits in Academic Writing, mathematics, sciences, and computer  programming may earn credits through proficiency examinations, if such  examinations are allowed by the departments offering these courses.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="u" id="u"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Registration Approval</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">All incoming freshmen and transfer students  need approval of a college advisor before registration for courses.  Such approval is typically obtained during the orientation visit to the  campus. All continuing students need approval from their faculty  advisor before registering for courses.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="v" id="v"></a>Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses</span><br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students may repeat a course to increase  their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under  which repeating a course is advisable and to a student&rsquo;s advantage.  There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage  a student and narrow a student&rsquo;s options. Some colleges require  students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic  advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>
<p>Courses  with A or B grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C  grade may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated  once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for  the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript.  The original grade will be calculated into the grade point average,  unless the student initiates a request for <em>Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation </em>as described below. Only one registration for the course counts toward  the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be  repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course  is a prerequisite.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To repeat a course  more than once requires written permission from the student&rsquo;s college  dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of  intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated;  students should consult their college before repeating a course.</p>

<p> For the grade point average recalculation policy to apply, a student must   declare to his or her college the intent to repeat a course for a change of   grade. Students must submit this request to their college before the end of the   official add/drop period, no later than the second Friday of the fall and spring   semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of   Summer Session 2. The course must be repeated within three semesters of the receipt of the original grade, and it must be taken at UIC. Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students are allowed grade point average recalculation in up to four repeated courses. Under the course repeat policy, all courses taken and their grades appear on the transcript in the semester in which they were taken. Under the grade point average recalculation policy, the grade earned the first time the course is taken will be dropped from the calculation of the cumulative GPA and the grade(s) earned when the course is repeated will be used in the calculation. This rule holds, even if the second grade is lower than the first. If a course is repeated more than once, the first grade is not counted in the GPA, but all other grades for that course are calculated in the cumulative GPA.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Intercollege Transfer Students</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students enrolled in other UIC colleges who  wish to transfer to the College of Engineering may apply at any time  during the regular semester; see the <em>Transfer Students from Other  Colleges and Universities</em> section below for specific requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Students from Other Colleges and Universities</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">The College of Engineering admits qualified  transfer students from accredited institutions. Depending upon space  availability, admission preference will be given to individuals who  qualify as Illinois residents as determined by the University (see<em> Regulations Governing the Determination of State Residence Status for  Admission and Assessment of Student Tuition</em>). Generally 60 semester  hours (90 quarter hours) of transfer work must include English, math,  and science courses listed below for admission. Exceptional students  who have completed most of these listed English, math, and science  courses may be admitted even if they have not completed 60 semester  hours by the time of entry to the college. The college will consider  residents of the state of Illinois who have a transfer grade point  average of at least 2.50/4.00 in math/science/technical courses as well  as on a cumulative basis. Out-of-state residents must have a minimum  transfer GPA (math/science/technical and cumulative) of 2.50/4.00 and  international students that of 2.75/4.00 to be considered for  admission. Admission criteria may vary for different programs. Meeting  the minimum criteria does not guarantee admission due to limited space  availability.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">All transfer applicants should complete the following course work by the time of entry to the College of Engineering:</p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li> Academic Writing (two courses).</li>
      <li> Chemistry, equivalent to Chemistry 112 at UIC. (Computer Science  students may substitute Biological Sciences or Earth and Environmental  Sciences.)</li>
      <li> Physics for engineers,  emphasizing mechanics, electricity, and magnetism (with calculus as a  prerequisite). (Computer Science students may substitute Biological  Sciences or Earth and Environmental Sciences.)</li>
      <li> Mathematics through differential equations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All transferable courses must have a grade of C or better in order to be considered for credit toward a degree in the College of Engineering.</p>
    <p>See the <em>Admissions</em> section for application deadline dates and other procedures for transfer students.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Transferring Out of the College</span></p>
