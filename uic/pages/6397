<p>The College of  Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a unique group of schools and affiliated units  dedicated to the investigation, creation, and interpretation of our physical,  social, and sensory environments. With degree programs in the visual arts,  design, theatre and music, architecture, and art history, the college is the  only place in Chicago where one can prepare for a career in the arts and design  within a major research university. The college is home to an energetic, award-winning  faculty of practicing architects, artists, designers, museum professionals, art  historians, musicians, directors, and theatrical performers. Through their  instruction and ongoing research, the faculty introduces students to  disciplinary and professional themes of contemporary importance and fosters a  vibrant atmosphere of intellectual and creative inquiry.</p>
<p>The College of  Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a leader in visual and performing arts  and design education and research in the city of Chicago, the nation, and the  world. The college considers its location in Chicagoâ€”a world-class cultural  center, and a site of complex social realitiesâ€”a primary asset. It has  developed partnerships with significant local museums, theaters, firms, and  other cultural institutions, as well as collaborations with a wide range of  programs across the university. UIC&rsquo;s status as an urban public institution drives  the college&rsquo;s interest in engaging urban issues and providing access to  excellence in the arts and design to diverse audiences. </p>
<p>From this  setting, the college also advances a global agenda: to break ground in the arts  and arts research and to generate new knowledge, informed by both historical  precedent and the use of new technologies for expression and instruction. The College  of Architecture, Design, and the Arts extends the traditional boundaries of research  and practice in order to meet the challenges of a changing economy. Faculty and  students alike realize that the next generation of graduates must be equipped  to operate creatively and knowledgeably in a broadening cultural arena and to  think with an international perspective. To that end, the college has attracted  a number of internationally recognized faculty and developed student exchange  programs in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy,  The Netherlands, Mexico, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland. </p>
<p>The College of  Architecture, Design, and the Arts is composed of the School of Architecture,  the School of Art and Art History, the School of Design, and the School of  Theatre and Music, as well as the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, a National Historic  Landmark and museum committed to social justice, and Gallery 400, a dynamic,  cutting edge contemporary art gallery. Curricula are offered in architecture, art,  art history, design, and theatre and music, leading to the baccalaureate in  those fields. The core of the architecture programs is the intensive development  of design work and ideas in the studio, supported by courses in architectural  theory and technology. Art and art history emphasize social and global  awareness and contemporary conceptual inquiry through both visual and scholarly  production. Design programs develop sophisticated form-making skills in order  to produce designers adept at formulating and advocating ideas. The School of  Theatre and Music provides innovative, rigorous, and comprehensive academic and  performance programs as part of its diverse, urban context.</p>
<p>All work  submitted by students for credit in any course in the college belongs to the  Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois; the University reserves the  right to retain, copyright, use, exhibit, reproduce, and publish any work so  submitted. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0;"> <a name="b" id="b"></a><span class="clsSubHead">Accreditation </span> </p>
    <p>Qualified  graduates from the Bachelor of Science in Architecture program may  apply for advanced standing in the School&rsquo;s professional Master of  Architecture degree program, or at other accredited schools of  architecture. The University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Master of  Architecture program is accredited by the National Architectural  Accrediting Board (NAAB). Master&rsquo;s degree programs may consist of a  preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate  degree, which, when earned sequentially, comprise an accredited  professional education. Although oriented to NAAB criteria, UIC&rsquo;s  undergraduate preprofessional degree is not an accredited professional  degree. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="clsSubHead3" style="margin-bottom: 0;"> General Education Core </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">General Education at UIC is designed to  serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. Students are required to  complete a minimum of 24 semester hours in the General Education Core  with at least one course from each of the following categories:</p>
<ol type="I" style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>Analyzing the Natural World</li>
  <li>Understanding the Individual and Society</li>
  <li>Understanding the Past</li>
  <li>Understanding the Creative Arts</li>
  <li>Exploring World Cultures</li>
  <li>Understanding U.S. Society</li>
</ol>
<p> For a description and a list of courses for each  General Education Core category, students should consult the <em><a href="https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/cat1315/GE.shtml">General  Education</a></em> section of the catalog. Information on meeting the General  Education Core requirements for each degree program is provided in the<em> College  of Architecture, Design, and the Arts</em> school sections. </p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3">General Education Proficiencies&mdash;University Writing Requirement</span><br />
College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts  students meet the requirement by achieving a passing grade in English 160 and  161.</p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3"><strong>UIC First Year  Dialogue Seminar</strong></span><strong><br />
    </strong>The  College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts requires all new incoming freshmen  in the college to complete CC 120â€”UIC First Year Dialogue Seminar (1 hour). CC  120 is an 8-week, 1-credit hour course focusing on diversity and dialogue. </p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Foundation Course Requirements</span> <br />
Each school and department in the college has a  different set of foundation and major course requirements. Students must  fulfill all the foundation and major course requirements outlined for their  degree program.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="f" id="f"></a>Other Requirements</span>        </p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Course Level Requirement</span><br />
Each school or department in the College of  Architecture, Design, and the Arts has specific upper-level requirements for  their degree programs. Students should consult the individual unit for details  on required 200-, 300-, or 400-level course work.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Course Work Limitations</span><br />
  Course work that  duplicates previous credit does not count toward graduation; no credit is given  for a course in which a failing grade is received.</p>
<p>Credit earned in  ENGL 050, 060, 070, and 071 and Mathematics 070 and 090 will not  fulfill college degree requirements. (By exception, students may earn 3  semester hours of credit in English 070 or 071 and receive a waiver of English  160 for the term in which they receive written authorization from the  Department of English.) </p>
<p>Students whose  placement test results require taking several courses that carry no graduation  credit should plan on additional terms of enrollment to complete the required  curriculum. All courses are included, however, for determining a student&rsquo;s  full-time/part-time status; for computing cumulative grade point averages  (except for 000-level courses); and in determining probation, dismissal, and  Dean&rsquo;s List statuses.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Elective Credit</span><br />
  The University,  college, school, and department degree requirements may not provide all the hours  required for graduation. The remaining credits are completed through elective  courses, whose careful selection should serve to enrich students&rsquo; knowledge and  understanding. Elective courses should always be chosen for educational ends  and not for the sake of convenience. </p>
<p> <span class="clsSubHead3">Full-Time Enrollment</span><br />
      Students in the college are expected to carry a full-time load in order to make satisfactory progress toward 
    their  degree. Students should consult with their school/department advisor if  they enroll in a part-time schedule to determine their degree progress  and projected graduation date.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</span><br />
College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts  students cannot graduate with less than a 2.00/4.00 GPA in all work taken at  UIC, in all work taken in the major field, and in all work accepted for  transfer by the University (transfer work plus work taken at UIC).</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate</span><br />
  Students who are  within two terms of graduation should first contact their school or department  and the college office for a complete check of their progress toward the  degree. A diploma cannot be ordered until a student has completed this  graduation check. </p>
<p>Students declare  their intent to graduate online using <em>my.UIC</em>. The deadline for  submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and  spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is  sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of  the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a  student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student&rsquo;s  name will be placed on the official degree list.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Enrollment Residence Requirement</span><br />
  Either the first 90 or last 30 credit hours of degree work must be  completed in continuous, uninterrupted enrollment residence at UIC.  Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and  another collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at  another institution, when approved by the student&rsquo;s college, does not  interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation.  Students who transfer from an accredited community college must earn at  least 60 credit hours at an approved four-year institution and must  meet the enrollment residence requirement of earning the last 30  semester hours at UIC.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Credit</span><br />
    No more than 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) of credit may be accepted as transfer work from a community or  junior college. Transfer students from community or junior colleges  should consult with the major department or school to discuss transfer  credit. All final acceptance of transfer credit will be determined by  the college upon review of recommendations by the school or department.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Transfer Credit for Continuing Students</span><br />
Continuing students in the College of  Architecture, Design, and the Arts must submit a petition in order to take  courses at other universities for credit toward the baccalaureate degree.</p>
<p class="clsSubHead" style="margin-top: 0;"> <a name="g" id="g"></a>College Policies</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="h" id="h"></a></span>Academic Load</span> <br />
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">During the fall and spring semesters, a full-time program is from 12 to 18 hours. Above 18 semester hours is 
    considered  an overload and may only be taken if a student is recommended by a  school or department advisor and approved in the college office. For  Summer Session 1 (Four-Week) and Summer Session 2 (Eight-Week), UIC  considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours as the minimum number  necessary to constitute full-time enrollment, and a program of more  than 14 hours must be approved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="i" id="i"></a>Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules</span> </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students on academic probation are notified by letter 
          to see a college advisor for counseling. Counseling is viewed by the college as an important determinant in 
          the retention of students. Students may be referred to 
    the  Counseling Center or other campus offices as deemed appropriate for  retention purposes. Counseling may be made part of the conditions of  academic probation.</p>
<p>Probationary status is determined by letter grades 
          earned at the end of any term. Grades of I (Incomplete) 
    do not exempt a student from probationary and dismissal regulations.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Probation Rules</span> <br />
    <strong>Academic Probation</strong>.  A student whose term grade point average or UIC cumulative grade point  average or combined UIC and transfer grade point average is below  2.00/4.00 is placed on academic probation and advised to enroll  full-time for a minimum of 12 semester hours of credit and earn grades  of B or better the next term in residence, excluding the summer  session. Students unable to maintain a minimum of 12 semester hours of  enrollment should consult with a college advisor to establish a plan  for satisfactory progress.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Probation</strong>. A  student who is on probationary status for two consecutive terms is  placed on terminal probation. The student is required to make an  appointment to see an advisor in the college office during the third  and fourth weeks of the following semester. Students on terminal  probation may be dismissed for poor academic progress and are  jeopardizing their enrollment in the University.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead3">Dismissal Rules</span><br />
      A student on academic or terminal probation may be 
    dismissed from the University under one of the following conditions:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li> Failure to earn at least a 2.00/4.00 (C) average while on academic probation. </li>
      <li>Failure to meet any special conditions stated at the time of probation.</li>
      <li>Failure to earn at least 3 hours of credit and whose term grade point average is 1.00/4.00.</li>
      <li>Failure to make progress towards completion of the degree requirements of the college.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br />
      Students should follow the advice in the letter sent  
    to them.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="j" id="j"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Admission for First Year Students</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Admission to the college is highly selective and competitive, and admission standards
          are much higher than the minimum ACT/SAT and HSPR for the campus. Due to the high
          demand for limited spaces in the college&rsquo;s programs, it is recommended applicants
          submit their credentials as early as possible in their senior year in order to have
          the best chance for admission. All admission decisions are final due to the demand
          for space in all programs. All programs require international applicants to present
          a minimum Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score of 80, with subscores of Reading 19, Listening 17, Speaking 20,
    and Writing 21 (Internet-basedl).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="k" id="k"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Change of Course Schedule&mdash;Dropping Courses</span></p>
    <p>Undergraduate students may drop  courses using <em>my.UIC</em> through the end of the second week of classes for  fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the  first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and  spring semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session  1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2) students may drop courses with the  permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in  fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop  occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the  second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2),  a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4  UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during  their entire undergraduate degree program. College of Architecture, Design, and  the Arts students must complete a request form in 208 JH.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="l" id="l"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Change of Major</span> <br />
  Students wishing to change majors within the college should consult the  individual school or department advisor(s) and complete an application  in the college 
    student affairs office, 208 JH.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="m" id="m"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Class Attendance</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students are expected to attend all lectures, discussions, and laboratory/studio sessions. School or department 
    faculty may establish minimum attendance requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="n" id="n"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Closed Courses</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">No student may be admitted to a closed course in the 
    college unless  the director or chairperson has approved an increase in capacity, which  is usually restricted by educational policies, budget, and maximum room  capacities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="o" id="o"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Course Prerequisites</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Course prerequisites are listed in both the <em>Undergraduate Catalog</em> and  the semester <em>Schedule of Classes</em>. Only the director or chairperson may  waive a prerequisite, if given evidence that the student is adequately  prepared to pursue the subject area.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="p" id="p"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Credit/No Credit Option</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Students may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option according
    to the following provisions:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>The student must be in good standing.  Students on probation or whose status is undetermined at the time in  which they elect the option are not eligible. </li>
      <li>A  maximum of 21 semester hours of credit may be earned at UIC under the  credit/no credit option. If a student withdraws from a credit/no credit  course before the end of the last day of instruction in the tenth week  of the term, the credit hours the course carries will not count toward  the total of 21 authorized. </li>
      <li>No more than one course per term may be taken under this option. </li>
      <li>This option may not be used in any course required for the major or  a minor, including prerequisite and collateral courses. This includes  any course specifically listed by rubric or course number as a  requirement in a student&rsquo;s curriculum. </li>
      <li>Under certain conditions, electives may be taken under credit/no  credit; courses being used for specific graduation requirements (such  as art history electives) must be taken for a letter grade. For  specific credit/no credit rules for prerequisite and collateral courses, please see an advisor in the Office of Student Affairs located in Room 208, Jefferson Hall.</li>
      <li>This option may not be used for English 160 
    and 161. </li>
      <li>Students may not use credit/no credit to satisfy foreign language  requirements in college programs requiring one- or two-year sequences. </li>
      <li>The credit/no credit option cannot be revoked after the close of the tenth day of instruction in the term. </li>
      <li>Instructors are not informed that the option has been elected but assign a letter grade in the usual manner. </li>
      <li>For courses taken under the credit/no credit option, a grade of CR is  recorded on the transcript if a letter grade of A, B, C, or D is  earned. If the letter grade F is assigned, an NC is entered on the  transcript. I and DF grades are replaced by CR or NC upon completion of  the courses or converted to NC if the course completion deadline for an  I is not met. </li>
      <li>The grades of CR  and NC are not used in the computation of the grade point average. It  is the responsibility of the student to determine eligibility under the  credit/no credit option. </li>
          
      <li>Students       must apply at their college office no later than the tenth day of the term       (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2)       to have a course designated for credit/no credit grading option. Students       must report to the Office of Student Affairs, 208 JH to complete a credit/no       credit request form. </li>
      <li>Students       with questions concerning their eligibility should make an appointment       with a college advisor.<br />

    <p><span class="clsSubHead3">Double Degrees<br />
    </span> A student may receive two degrees concurrently  from the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. The student must  complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit beyond the requirements of  the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. The student must  additionally meet all the requirements for the second degree specified by the  college and the major. Students seeking double degrees should contact the  appropriate school or department for a curriculum evaluation and then make a  declaration for double degrees in the college office.</p>
<p><span class="clsSubHead3">Second Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree<br />
  </span> Students who have already earned a bachelor&rsquo;s  degree from UIC or another institution may receive a second bachelor&rsquo;s degree  from the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. Students seeking a  second bachelor&rsquo;s degree must formally apply to the program. The student must  complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit beyond the requirements of  the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. The student must  additionally meet all the requirements for the second degree specified by the  college and the major.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="s" id="s"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Full-Time Enrollment</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students in the college are expected to carry a full-time load in order  to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. Students should  consult with their school/department advisor if they enroll in a  part-time schedule to determine the consequences to their degree  program and projected graduation date.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="t" id="t"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Graduate-Level Courses for Undergraduate
    Credit</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">With school or department approval, an  undergraduate student may enroll in a course in the Graduate College  (500-level) for undergraduate elective credit. Students should obtain  approval prior to enrollment. </p>
    <p>Students should understand, however, that graduate courses do not automatically apply toward an undergraduate  degree. Additionally, graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate  student are generally not applicable toward a graduate degree. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="u" id="u"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Independent Study</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">The college offers courses entitled Independent Study, in which a  student&rsquo;s special interests may be pursued under the direction of a  faculty member. To enroll in such a course, the student must obtain  consent of the instructor and the school or department offering the  course.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="v" id="v"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Petition Procedure</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Any rule, regulation, or action of the college may be appealed through  the use of a student petition. Petitions are available in the college  office. It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain all necessary  approvals on the form before submitting it to the college office for  review. Turning in the form does not guarantee approval of the request.  Students will be notified of a decision, but they should inquire about the  status of their petition after ten working days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="w" id="w"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Proficiency Examinations</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students interested in earning proficiency credit should contact the  school or department directly for information concerning eligibility. A  student who earns proficiency credit is given the amount of credit  toward graduation regularly allowed in the course. Proficiency credit  is not considered an interruption of enrollment residence for  graduation, nor does it apply toward satisfying the minimum requirement  of the degree if the last 30 semester hours must be earned in  enrollment residence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="x" id="x"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Registration Approval</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students in the Department of Art History and the School of  Theatre and Music must consult with an advisor for registration. An  advising hold will be placed on each registration and will only be  released upon verification of department advising.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a name="y" id="y"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Students may repeat a course to increase  their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under  which repeating a course is advisable and to a student&rsquo;s advantage.  There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage  a student and narrow a student&rsquo;s options. Some colleges require  students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic  advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>
<p>Courses  with A or B grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C  grade may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated  once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for  the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript.  The original grade will be calculated into the grade point average,  unless the student initiates a request for <em>Repeating a Course with  Grade Point Average Recalculation</em> as  described below. Only one registration for the course counts toward the  total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be  repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course  is a prerequisite.</p>
    <p>To repeat a course  more than once requires written permission from the student&rsquo;s college  dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of  intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated;  students should consult their college before repeating a course.</p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3"><a name="y" id="y2"></a>Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation</span><br />
    <strong>Important Note</strong>: Grade point average recalculation for a repeated course<strong> is not</strong> automatic. The student must initiate a request in the college office as outlined below.</p>
<p> For the grade point average recalculation policy to apply, a student must   declare to his or her college the intent to repeat a course for a change of   grade. Students must submit this request to their college before the end of the   official add/drop period, no later than the second Friday of the fall and spring   semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of   Summer Session 2. The course must be  repeated within three semesters of the receipt of the original grade,  and it must be taken at UIC. Only one registration for the course  counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.</p>
    <p>Undergraduate  students are allowed grade point average recalculation in up to four  repeated courses. Under the course repeat policy, all courses taken and  their grades appear on the transcript in the semester in which they  were taken. Under the grade point average recalculation policy, the  grade earned the first time the course is taken will be dropped from  the calculation of the cumulative GPA and the grade(s) earned when the  course is repeated will be used in the calculation. This rule holds,  even if the second grade is lower than the first. If a course is  repeated more than once, the first grade is not counted in the GPA, but  all other grades for that course are calculated in the cumulative GPA.</p>
    <p><a name="bb" id="bb"></a><span class="clsSubHead2">Transferring</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <span class="clsSubHead3">Intercollege Transfer Students </span> <br />
    UIC students interested in admission to one of the majors offered in  the college must complete an intercollegiate application available in  the college office, 208 Jefferson Hall. All applicants must be in good  standing, not on academic probation or undetermined status. Eligibility  varies by department and school.</p>
