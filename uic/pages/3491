<p>Starting this spring, the Honors College introduced a new advanced Honors seminar—HON 401: Leadership, an extension of a previous seminar—that focuses on fostering leadership among Honors College students. Taught by Department of Managerial Studies Associate Professor Jenny Hoobler, the course guides students through leadership theory, research, and practice while attempting to uncover each student’s authentic leadership style. “I really want to get the point across to students that leaders come in all shapes, sizes, and variations,” says Professor Hoobler.</p>
<p>With guest speakers from organizations and businesses based in the Chicago area, students see first-hand how great leaders can be found in their own communities and are encouraged to tap into insights of leadership roles and perspectives. From leaders like Alderman Jason Ervin to the President and CEO of the Women’s Business Development Center Emilia Dimenco, the guest speakers fall nothing short of inspirational.</p>
<p>The three credit-hour course also gives students the time and opportunity to allow them to discover their own leadership potential. The class uses multi-factor leadership questionnaires to assess leadership potential and determine areas where students can improve. “I think it’s really important for students at this level to get that professional development and feedback,” states Professor Hoobler.</p>
<div id="attachment_707" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-25-at-9.00.43-PM.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-707" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-25-at-9.00.43-PM.png" alt="Scott Dikkers, founding editor of The Onion, spoke to UIC students as part of the HON 401 Leadership Seminar." width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scott Dikkers, founding editor of The Onion, spoke to UIC students as part of the HON 401 Leadership Seminar.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Students’ professional development goes far beyond these assessments. Students also submit an article to a student academic journal of their choosing on a topic related to leadership towards the end of the semester.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Professor Hoobler feels that her students are very interested and engaged in the class and adds that the chance for students to discuss their research questions is mutually beneficial. “That kind of environment where students are contributing and I’m sharing research that I really care about with them completely summarizes why I do this,” says Professor Hoobler. “It really gives me an intellectual charge to be able to do that. It’s the perfect environment for me, and I hope the students have benefitted from that as well.”</p>
<p>Professor Hoobler hopes to continue teaching this seminar, bringing in more community leaders who can inspire and help develop leaders among all Honors College students.</p>

		<p>On February 19, the Honors College sponsored a special interactive seminar for students led by Dr. Jose Oberholzer which aimed to foster the brainstorming of cross-disciplinary solutions for the diabetes epidemic within the United States. Dr. Oberholzer—a Professor of Surgery, Endocrinology and Diabetes, and Bioengineering at the UIC School of Medicine—also serves as the Director of the Islet and Pancreas Transplant Program and the Chief of the Division of Transplantation in addition to leading the Chicago Diabetes Project, an international coalition of scientists who conduct research in the hopes of discovering a cure for diabetes.</p>
<p>Dr. Oberholzer facilitated this innovative Honors College seminar to challenge students to analyze the societal effects of the diabetes pandemic and to understand the importance of leadership and involvement from people of various sectors in working to solve this public health crisis.</p>
<div id="attachment_697" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSCN0017.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-697" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSCN0017.jpg" alt="Dr. Jose Oberholzer leads a discussion on diabetes." width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Jose Oberholzer leads a discussion on<br />diabetes.</p></div>
<p>Students from several majors attended the seminar. Simbiat Olayiwola, a senior majoring in biochemistry, says she attended because she wanted to learn more about the diabetes epidemic.<br />
Olayiwola notes that “Some of what I discovered [during the lecture] truly amazed me.” One of the things that Dr. Oberholzer discussed during the seminar was the possibility of using surgery to treat diabetes. Olayiwola also enjoyed engaging with students who held different<br />
ideas and perspectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sergio Villasenor, an industrial design major, also attended the seminar to<br />
learn more about diabetes. Villasenor’s views broadened as he listened to Dr. Oberholzer: “An interesting thing [I learned] was that diabetes [is] prevalent in poorer areas with no walkways [and in] high crime areas where people are less likely to walk. This leaves us with possible solutions for redesigning city layouts.” Olayiwola adds, “[There is] the common belief that the consumption of excessive sugary foods leads [to] diabetes. This is not always true since genetics, habits, environmental [factors], and immune status all play a role in the development of the disease.”</p>

<p>Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle came to UIC on October 18th to talk to students about “Reform in Cook County Government” as part of the Future of Chicago Lecture Series co-sponsored by the Department of Political Science and the Honors College. The talk included a question-and-answer session and was followed by a luncheon in Burnham Hall.</p>
<p>During the lecture, Preckwinkle spoke to her past as a teacher and touched on her exposure to politics as a teenager, experiences she regarded as invaluable to her decision to run for office. Preckwinkle also outlined many of her key policy concerns and explained how the Cook County budget is spent. In the luncheon that followed, Honors College students had the opportunity to talk in-depth with Preckwinkle about her career, policies, and motivation. Throughout both the talk and luncheon, Preckwinkle engaged the students with her progressive policies and positions regarding immigration reform, business subsidies, urban planning, and healthcare. Senior Katherine Feekin, a student in the Urban and Public Affairs program, said of the event, “The opportunity to attend a small luncheon with [Preckwinkle] after the lecture was incredible. She is an inspiring woman, and I was so thankful to be able to meet her in a more personal setting. She spoke candidly about her life and her views, and it is not an experience I will soon forget.”</p>
</div>

<p>When asked about the biggest challenge for Chicago that Preckwinkle observes from her post on the Cook County Board, she replied, “Chicago is [seen as] a place of political corruption for a lot of people in Illinois [&#8230;] There’s that legacy that’s hard to overcome.” Additionally, Preckwinkle Toni Preckwinkle holds healthcare as a high priority, and 35% of the $3 billion county budget goes towards this area. Her other priorities include public safety and economic development. Last year Preckwinkle rolled back the sales tax increase implemented by her predecessor Todd Stroger, something she cited as a first in Cook County history. She has also worked for the past three years to reduce the numbers of pre-trial detainees sitting in jails. Chicago and Cook County have the largest unified court system in the United States, but case disposal is slow and jails become “an intersection of racism and poverty,” as she called it, due to questionable policing efforts that target specific areas and nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p>As the luncheon concluded, she urged students to “find a candidate you believe in. Get behind them and back them all the way.”</p>

<p>The spirit of innovation and creativity ignites a spark in thousands of people across the city of Chicago each year during Chicago Ideas Week (CIW). The annual conference transforms the city into a hub of intellectual activity as the best and brightest gather in Chicago to give presentations and share ideas. Among the 25,000 attendees at this year’s October 14-20 conference were several Honors College students who received tickets through the College from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>While many idea-based events are exclusive, Chicago Ideas Week is set apart because the events are intended for all members of the public. The mission of CIW is to provoke thought, create connections, and encourage people to achieve great things. The events take place in a variety of formats. Some are lectures with a series of speakers discussing aspects of a given field, while others are labs that give attendees a behind-the-scenes look at a particular industry. These events take place all over the city, including one at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory, where the “walls” are 3D TVs that allow total immersion in futuristic technology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Throughout the week, participants could sample everything from glass-blowing workshops to discussions on the tumult in the Middle East to stories of successful entrepreneurs and authors. Attendees also could hear talks by people from a variety of backgrounds, including New York Times best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and MySpace founders Chris and Tim Vanderhook.</p>
<p>Honors College sophomores Hannah Lee and Erika Peters attended the “Explorers” lecture with tickets provided by the Honors College in collaboration with the OVCR. After listening to professional BASE jumpers, National Geographic photojournalists, and oceanic scientists, Lee and Peters felt their horizons had expanded. According to Lee, “The talk inspired me to travel more and push myself outside of my comfort zone.” “They really emphasized the fact that people are only limited by their perceived boundaries,” Peters added.</p>
<p>Sophomore Amy Halder attended the lecture “Music: Evolution of the Artist.” Like many CIW events, this lecture featured a variety of speakers from a single field. Together the speakers’ multiple perspectives provided a cohesive image of the music industry. For example, artist Rachel Yamagata spoke about the process of writing a song, songwriter Mike Posner contributed ideas about artistic collaboration, and Lollapalooza founder Marc Geiger spoke about how technology and social media have changed the music industry. Halder explained, “One of the artists mentioned that music is like catching a butterfly—you need to be gentle and caring. Posner followed that talk by saying that the job of a producer is to bottle that butterfly in a beautiful jar and present it to the audience.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This holistic approach to the lectures is a defining feature of CIW, because individuals are more likely to be spurred into action by understanding multiple aspects of a certain topic or field. As future leaders, Honors College students are perfectly primed to create change in the world. The first step, however, is becoming passionate about an idea and deciding to do something about it: exactly what Chicago Ideas Week hopes to encourage.</p>
