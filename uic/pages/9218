<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/clean-2.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail " src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/clean-2-80x80.png" alt="" width="119" height="119" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The tape has been annotated with the word &#8220;CLEAN&#8221;<em> &#8212; but are these IV pumps clean or do they need to be cleaned? </em> That depends on whether the reader (or for that matter the writer) intended the word “clean” as an adjective or an imperative.  If an adjective, then these pumps are indeed clean and ready for use.  However, if this is an imperative then these pumps need to be cleaned. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, as I came to learn, this is the practice for letting techs know that these pumps are actually clean (i.e., they have been cleaned in the past and may now be used).  However, this practice may not be clear to visiting staff (e.g., during an overnight transplant case). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hospitals need to streamline communication so that there are predictable inputs and outputs.  Color-coding clean vs. dirty might not be a bad idea &#8212; but what about individuals who are visually impaired in the detection of certain colors?  Perhaps a color + icon system would work better.  Such a system could be applied to scrub receptacles, waste bins, blanket receptacles, etc. – but ideally, the practice would allow easy determination of whether an item (or in this case a set of items) is clean or not clean for reusable equipment subject to cleaning. </p>

<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt">On Friday, we visited Central Sterile (CS).  CS is a place that receives supplies that are shipped to the hospital and which processes all equipment that moves to or from operating rooms (and other hospital care environments).  We were impressed by CS and its leadership.  It seems that CS has done an immense amount of studying its processes for efficiency.   We were told that at some point the loading dock from which CS receives its supplies was used as a set for the TV series &#8220;ER.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt"> </p>
<div style="direction: ltr;margin-top: 0in;margin-left: 0in;width: 7.6041in">
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt">Improvements in efficiency for CS moving surgical equipment to various ORs and other treatment areas seem to involve bundling surgical kits into larger sterile boxes that can be sanitized or moved more easily together.  Since a hip surgery can use 8-20 surgical trays (kits), moving supplies <em>en mass</em> within larger sterile boxes can help to organize and save time.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt">Here is an example of a sterile cube for sterilizing a plurality of surgical kits together.  After sterilization, these kits can be moved to a site of use together.  </p>

<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span>Week 4 (June 20-23, Tuesday &#8211; Friday) began with a lecture from an Anesthesiology staff physician on the infant airway &#8211; i.e., that it can be difficult because it has ~15x more airway resistance than that of adults and a more compliant chest wall.  Care for an infant patient needs to be thoughtfully developed in view of the special needs that an infant patient has.  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span>This week, we wanted to more directly find opportunity for innovation in the hospital, so we started to ask more direct questions &#8212; more interviewing.  We began by observing a vasculature procedure where the surgeon was interested in a clip to secure one end of vasculature onto a device for boring through tissue because this was an issue he frequently encountered.  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span>We have noticed that while interviews can be structured, that we get a lot of insight when asking practitioners what their problems are quite candidly.  Practitioners (and other employees) often have a major problem they can identify immediately because this problem bothers them so frequently.  This was the case with a member of an ophthalmology surgical team.  When asked what his greatest issue was, he discussed the difficulty of manipulating one of his devices, holding a patient&#8217;s eyelid open with one hand, and also adjusting a light source.  We think this is a good example of how easy it can be to get to the real question that devils someone&#8217;s everyday work experience.  Most people know what bothers them each day.  If they think a solution can be crafted &#8212; or that there is any chance you might be able to do this for them &#8212; they are more than willing to tell you about the worst part of their work experience.  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span>Other times, you cannot question a practitioner directly (e.g., because there isn&#8217;t one around, or when they are preoccupied by rendering care); Chris likened the experience of finding insight into clinical or technological problems in the hospital to the experience of fishing &#8212; i.e., there is a lot of waiting, punctuated by moments (sometimes a few minutes) of activity (or insight, in the case of looking for issues in a workplace).</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span>On rare occasion, someone will share an issue to which they believe there is absolutely no solution.  I don&#8217;t challenge their belief that there isn&#8217;t a solution &#8212; but I tend to believe that there almost certainly is a solution.  For most problems, there is a solution &#8212; and if there isn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t see what the benefit of assuming that there isn&#8217;t would do for anyone.  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11.0pt"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in;font-family: Georgia;font-size: 12pt"><span>More commonly, we find that practitioners or other employees can immediately point to an issue they experience that causes them tremendous frustration in the workplace but they rarely take the next step to craft a solution.  While hospitals, management and administration are often immediately interested in the solutions (and IP) that their employees generate, how interested are they in the problems of their employees? </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In terms of the local environments where supplies are managed, there doesn’t seem to be a uniform policy on managing supplies (e.g., reviewing to avoid unintentional product expiration).  In one OR, we found that supplies were conveniently situated, but that users could not easily determine what supplies were behind which supply area unless one were to unlock and remove a metal door that covered the supply cabinets.  This kind of setup is certainly secure, but difficult for ease of supply management and access for use.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/metal-cabinet-3-jpg.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/metal-cabinet-3-jpg-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="168" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we asked technicians (who were accessing these cabinets and using supplies from these areas) whether these supplies would be easier to manage if the cabinets had transparent doors, the technicians indicated that this would be preferable to the metal, opaque doors that are currently in use. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In another OR, we found a cabinet for storing supplies that did have a set of translucent (presumably glass) doors – so visualizing supplies was easy (although not necessarily for the purpose of determining expiry date).  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glass-door-1-jpg.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glass-door-1-jpg-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="152" height="152" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, this cabinet was not well designed to house the variety of plastic containers in which supplies were situated – so the doors failed to fully close and required a piece of Velcro to hold them in place when the cabinet was essentially closed.  During the course of a procedure, sometimes the doors would be ineffectively shut and would remain open.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glass-door-2-jpg.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glass-door-2-jpg-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="138" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On a separate (more pervasive) note, it is also interesting that the hospital is not part of a hospital network.  This means that it presumably relinquishes leverage when determining per unit prices on stocks that may be ordered in massive bulk quantities (e.g., as between a plurality of hospitals that are part of a care network).  After all, this kind of thinking has been a major driver of integrating care networks over the past few decades. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The hospital also seems to inexplicably lose scrubs, sheets and blankets.  We wondered if perhaps it might be time to start RFID tagging these items to ensure that people leaving the hospital don’t take these items with them.  This seems to be a constant, minor source of financial drain for the hospital. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On Friday, Nicholas and I visited the OB/GYN clinic and observed an epidural placement.  After this session, Nicholas and I wondered if perhaps there isn’t a better way to design an apparatus for epidural placement.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ropes-course-jpg-3.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ropes-course-jpg-3-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="162" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have been encouraged not to focus on the wires and tubes because this problem is so pervasive in the field and immediate solutions (e.g., using wireless connectivity) are conceivable only to a limited extent at this time without redesigning either the entire operating room (or other off-site suite), anesthesia machine – or both.  Nevertheless, the wires and tubes represent a true issue for practitioners.  In fact, Morgan and Mikhail’s Clinical Anesthesiology (5<sup>th</sup> Ed.) teaches that the single greatest source of injury to patients involving anesthesia machines is attributable to misconnects or disconnects.<sup>1</sup>&lt;!&#8211; [if supportFields]&gt;<span></span>&lt;![endif]&#8211;&gt;  So it is difficult not to think about the way that tubes and wires are situated in these quite special treatment environments. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One way that tubes and wires might be easier to keep track of is to bundle them and one way to make it easy to keep track of bundled wires and tubes is to color-code them. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center">(this kit is no longer in service but is used only as a comparison with the updated, redesigned kit)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> In contrast, the redesigned kit is housed in a nylon backpack.  Although this backpack does bear labels (indicating what is kept in its several compartments, see below), it is not clearly labeled to tell a user what this backpack stores in general (e.g., “emergency airway kit”) in the event that there is any doubt what it includes (which admittedly should be a rare coincidence). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The backpack is actually heavier than the original tackle kit, and while it can be transported on a user’s back, it can be difficult to deploy in an ED or other site of use because of the need to have a broad, flat surface upon which the kit can be deployed. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/re-designed-emergency-airway-kit-jpg.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/re-designed-emergency-airway-kit-jpg-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="124" height="124" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, when the backpack is opened, one finds that within the backpack, there are other nylon bags or compartments – which also need to be unzipped in order to retrieve items (e.g., MAC blade, medications, etc.).  Most of the storage capacity of this backpack is occupied by one bright yellow roll-out nylon/plastic storage surface that houses most of the kit&#8217;s essential supplies – but which requires a broad surface upon which the kit can be unrolled.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Here is the updated emergency airway kit when in use: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/emergency-airway-kit-in-use-jpg.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/emergency-airway-kit-in-use-jpg-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The bright yellow material draped over the top of this mobile shelf is the nylon/plastic storage surface that is itself stored within the main compartment of the nylon backpack (seen here sitting on the floor to the left of the mobile shelf unit) but which can be unrolled as one can see in this image (above).  Altogether, this means that one has to unzip the backpack, then unroll this yellow nylon/plastic material, and finally one must unzip the lesser compartments on the nylon/plastic surface.  All of this must happen before a user can access even the first tool – and some tools like the MAC blade have to be set up and checked before use. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Although we admire several of its properties, this bag captured our attention because we are not fully certain that it is preferable to the original tackle box design.  On balance, we acknowledge that the original tackle box lacked the ability to amply re-supply a user after an initial emergency event whereas the backpack has lesser pockets stocked with additional blades, biohazard disposal bags, syringes, plungers, etc. – so the additional weight of the backpack does add value to the pack.  Nevertheless, at least this writer would like to see a pack that is easier to deploy and use.  One option that comes to mind immediately is a kit that is optionally capable of being hanged from a hook or loop (or other improvement) that allows a user to deploy this inner kit much like a garment bag.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/travel-bag-jpg.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/travel-bag-jpg-80x80.png" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.tumi.com/p/tri-fold-carry-on-garment-bag-022137D2#">https://www.tumi.com/p/tri-fold-carry-on-garment-bag-022137D2#</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The advantage of such a design is that can deployed to a hanging position (optionally) so as to take up minimal horizontal space but where it uses mostly unused vertical space.  As between horizontal and vertical space in an operating room or emergency department, there seems to be more untapped vertical space in these environments (although I have not quantified this inclination).  Of course, if a user preferred to deploy such a system onto a more horizontal surface, this would still be possible.  One way to think about a system like this is that it gives the user the option to hang it – but one can still use this on a horizontal surface. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of my student colleagues mentioned the use of Velcro rather than a zipper to access the main or lesser compartments of such a bag &#8212; which seems like it might be a good idea.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interestingly, the garment bag (shown immediately above, also below) is actually a bag that unfolds from what initially looks and operates like a laptop bag:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Importantly, when I asked a resident who had just finished using the redesigned emergency airway kit if it would be preferable for the roll-out kit to be deployable to a vertical position to utilize vertical rather than horizontal space, the resident indicated that indeed, this would be desirable but was concerned that there might not be a suitable place to situate the kit in a vertical position (i.e., there might not be a suitable hanger neraby).  Nevertheless, I tend to think that adding a hook or other means of hanging the most fundamental part of this kit would at least enable this kit to be vertically positioned where space and other equipment allow for this &#8212; and where conditions do not allow for this, it can be deployed horizontally.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In regard to clinical experience, residents shared with us that end-of-life discussions are often difficult but that one usually grows through having these discussions with patients and their families.  Residents encouraged us to choose the ICU for a clinical rotation.  The ICU is said to be like detective work where anesthetists think about hemodynamics quite often.  Residents also encouraged us to select the Emergency Department (ED) for a rotation because this is often where patients present.  Residency, they tell us, is where one transitions from not having true responsibility for patient care to having responsibility for patient care. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As mentioned briefly in last week’s posts, I tend to think that observing small surgery fields is a common issue for graduate medical education because students need to follow the nuanced details of a surgical or other procedure in an environment where space is strongly limited. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday morning (June 7, 2017), we began the day with a case study involving an 8-year-old boy who had a difficult recovery following a tonsillectomy.  The reason the patient (a hypothetical) returned to the ED was that he had bleeding and pulmonary edema (swelling of the airway).  Residents tended to consider this patient as being an easier case than younger patients with lesser communication skills, but the complication of an airway that is itself bleeding illustrates the need for good technique when video-assisted intubation is not practical (i.e., because blood will occlude the camera).   </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also this week, I observed several Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions.  Although I had previously worked on a psychiatry floor while considering whether to apply to medical school, I had never observed one of these procedures.  I had read accounts of patients thrashing about but when an anesthesiologist is present, the patient can receive a muscle relaxant and this inhibits the muscular contractions in large measure.  This reduces the risk of harm to the patient but of course requires an anesthesiologist to monitor vitals, maintain respiration, administer medications and ensure proper recovery along with other staff.  Interestingly, the efficacy of the muscle relaxant is checked (often more than once) by using the Babinski reflex (stroking the bottom of the foot to elicit a dorsally reflexive movement of the foot / toes).  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Still involving the brain, I sat in on a neurosurgery this week.  Getting back to the topic of education and innovation in this realm, it is important to note how eagerly the residents study.  Here is a telling image of how a resident can study near the operating room to better comprehend the details of a procedure.  The app shown is Visible Body, which is a personal favorite for reviewing anatomy and for which I volunteer as a beta tester.  As education become increasingly interactive from an earlier stage (e.g., in the form of anatomy applications like Visible Body), this may help to alleviate some of the steep learning curves for medical students and residents.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we observe procedures on the unit, we typically split into 2-person groups with one IMED student pairing with one BIOE student.  Vijay (BIOE) and I started on Wednesday (May 31) by observing a triple bypass – which is quite a complex procedure.  Subsequently, Vijay and I have been thinking that this has skewed our perception so that other procedures seem mild in comparison.  The demands on operating room (OR) space, chord management, and staging of sterile tools is quite different (at least in terms of magnitude of supply and equipment) for complex procedures in comparison to less demanding procedures.  In regard to needs assessment, this might suggest making ORs specifically capable of accommodating more demanding procedures in particular regard to power supply, device placement, and cable / tube management about the operating field. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday, Chris (BIOE) and I observed a kidney transplant.  While the kidney was largely prepared for removal from the donor using a da Vinci Surgical System (i.e., laproscopically), once it had been removed, its preparation was finalized by a surgeon on a small operating table.  During this latter portion of the procedure, residents and medical students had difficulty observing the field.  This reminded me of the need to ensure that procedures that take place on small operation fields (without endo/laproscope) are broadcast to ensure that learners are able to follow the procedure. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Friday, Vijay (BIOE) and I observed the removal of a tumor from the maxillary sinus.  Again, because the operating field was so small, it reminded me of the need to make a small operating field easily visible for people who are not in sterile garments or enabled to stand near the operating table because of the strong limitations on space about the table.  Since we have observed the difficulty with which a small operation field can be viewed by learners, we tend to think that this is almost certainly an area that may be a proper subject of a problem and needs statement.  IMED students know well that during our M1 year, it was often difficult to observe dissections and various parts of teachbacks (i.e., a time when an M1 student who has performed a dissection teaches the dissection and anatomy one’s classmates who were not part of the dissecting team for a given laboratory session). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p>Of course, one might think that a technology like Google Glass would offer a potential solution to the difficulty of viewing a dissection (in medical school) or operation (on a clinical unit).  However, as Dr. Nishioka shared with us this week, the camera on Google Glass is fixed so that it projects directly out from the eyewear as if one were viewing an object that along a line of sight that is orthogonal with respect to the lens of the eyewear.  In practice, one finds often, one views a structure or object that is slightly below this – as if a surgeon were using a bifocal to observe a structure.  Accordingly, even a promising technology like Google Glass doesn’t seem to offer a viable solution for a great many scenarios where learners want to observe the detail in a small dissection or operating field.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt">The main goal of the clinical immersion program is to gain experience in using clinical observation to develop a <i>needs assessment</i>.  I am optimistic that we will take these initial steps with a longer view for questions of feasibility, cost, and other downstream elements in the process of innovation.  After all, this does seem to be what our readings in Biodesign seem to suggest – i.e., that one should identify problems and formulate needs assessments based in view of questions of feasibility, cost, and other factors.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt">Interestingly, although IMED students know each other reasonably well because of our work together in medical school and attending IMED lunch presentations on clinical innovation, the BIOE students seemed somewhat less acquainted with one another.  Nevertheless, everyone seems to be working together quite well and I do think it has to do with the idea that we focus on communicating well and welcoming the input of others. </p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt">Our clinical mentor is Dr. Nishioka.  IMED students recognize Dr. Nishioka right away because he visited the Class of 2020 during our first week to show us a Google Glass demo – e.g., that this technology could potentially allow the study of clinical medicine from afar.<sup>2</sup> </p>

Joseph Sauer is a registered patent attorney and holds inactive memberships with the Illinois and District of Columbia bars. Joseph graduated from Wheaton College with B.A. in psychology (2003) and B.S. in Biology (2006). He earned J.D. at Marquette University Law School (2006) and M.S. in Biotechnology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland (2010). Following completion of M.S. at Johns Hopkins, Joseph served as a psychiatric counselor at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore under Dr. Claude Smith. This experience proved transformative and Joseph decided to forego further training in the law in favor of medical school. While applying to medical school Joseph held teaching assistantships at the Harvard University Extension School in Physics and General Chemistry and served as a senior laboratory teaching fellow at Harvard College in Chemistry and Chemical Biology. In 2015, Joseph received a Certificate of Distinction in Teaching from the Bok Center, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. His research experience includes studying stapled peptide synthesis at the Verdine Laboratory, Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. Joseph is interested in cellular metabolism, drug development, biomedical devices and serving patients directly in clinical practice.</p>
