You have given us an incredible opportunity to not only observe what you do but also to understand why and experience medical technology and the hospital systems as you do. I&#8217;d also like to thank those of you reading now,  who have journeyed with me from not knowing what a bronchoscopy even was to assisting in one.</p>
<p>My understanding of both general health care and specific pulmonary challenges has grown so much in such a little time and as this program comes to an end, my hope is that my pursuit of the problems would not end here. My team and I plan to incorporate some of our solutions with involved faculty into research trials at the hospital and clinic. We hope to continue to learn about the problems at hand and continue to work together to solve them. Because I have seen the many problems doctors and hospitals have to deal with, I fear that our project won&#8217;t receive necessary funding or priority to move forward. But I will continue to hope that this program, my experience and these blogs will carry on to be a small part of a bigger solution.</p>

<p>On Friday two BAL Bronchoscopies were scheduled, however the primary bronchoscopy technician was gone for the holiday weekend. Because we&#8217;ve seen so many of these procedures done and were already going to be in the room, the doctor offered us the chance to assist in the place of the technician. While our assistance wasn&#8217;t as substantial as our excitement would lead you to believe, we the chance to work with the doctors as a team. I realized that as a bioengineer this was truly an amazing opportunity, we would never in our career get this close to the usage of the technology we design while interacting with not just the patients but the physicians, who are the users.</p>
<p>This was definitely one of the more exciting days, even looking back at my note book I did not write much down given all that was going on we didn&#8217;t get the chance too, luckily my colleagues and I got some great photos out of it.</p>

While I love observing procedures, I found these times to also be very beneficial. We had time to discuss problems and questions with different residents and fellows, and one of the things we began to focus on was delirium.</p>
<p>My hospital exposure before this program is very limited so I had no background knowledge of the medical term delirium. The residents explained to us that in the MICU patients who stayed for more than a day were at risk to becoming extremely confused because they would loose track of time and consciousness, this was especially the case the longer they stayed, they called this delirium.</p>
<p>A quick google search explains delirium as<em> a medical term for patients who enter a severe state of confusion due to temporary brain failure</em>. About 2 out of every 3 patients who come into the ICU will develop delirium and this percentage is higher for older patients, patients on benzodiazepines or breathing tubes. I also learned that there are many small interventions that seem to make a big impact in preventing delirium such as regulating the patients sleep/wake cycles and re-orientating the patients with family member/friend contact or even pictures. These seemed like easy and low cost solutions to a problem that not puts stress on the nurses and doctors, but increases the length of stay in the ICU, costing the hospital more money and decreasing the patients overall health, comfort and chances of survival. Which begs the question, <em>why haven&#8217;t any of these solutions been implemented?</em></p>
<p>Looking back at my observations of the MICU, this problem made a lot of sense. There are constant noises and alarms going off in and out of the patients room and hallways and almost all of the rooms are open, in fact many of the patients doors are glass. While delirium sound like a quick fix by simply avoiding disturbance to the patients sleep at night, with alarms that are needed to alert the nurses, vitals at 4am and medical supervision, how could they prioritize the patients sleep over their medical care? </p>

The process was very similar to the many bronchoscopies and transbronchial biopsies we’ve seen but slightly different mostly because of the ultrasound and needle aspiration. </p>
<p>An EBUS procedure allows the doctor to insert a needle into the lungs, or in this case a mass in the lungs, guided by an ultrasound to collect fluid/tissue samples for biopsy. This was so cool to me because conventionally a doctor would have to make an incision to biopsy which could take weeks to get back from the lab, however with the EBUS scope and in-room pathologist, there is no need to cut because it goes through the bronchoscope  and in the mouth, and the doctor can see a real time image of the lungs or mass accompanied by an ultrasound, allowing the pathologist to evaluate them immediately, requesting any additional samples right then and there. The safer, quicker and superior technology of EBUS over mediastinoscopy (conventional diagnostic surgery requiring an incision above the neck to access the chest) motivates me to look at current invasive procedures and surgeries and think, <em>is there a future for surgeries that won’t need stitches or leave scars?</em></p>
<p>Just like in the previous procedures, the patient was moderately sedated with lidocaine. Although at the start of this particular EBUS the doctors realized the patient was actually not sedated <em>enough</em> and so they stopped (after starting) and gave him more drugs. I think having an anesthesiologist during the procedure could have helped to prevent this but since this was a minor delay and is the only instance we’ve witnessed out of many other ok anesthetizing, I can see why one is not a requirement. </p>
<p>In a small procedure room (same room for the bronchoscopies) we fit a technician and his cart, a nurse and her cart, 4 doctors (a pathologist and her cart, 2 fellows and their attending), and 5 observers (us plus a medical student) along with all the machines and instruments in the room a you can kind of see in the picture below:</p>
<p><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-23-at-11.25.34-AM.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-23-at-11.25.34-AM-80x80.png" alt="EBUS Bronchoscopy 6/22/17" width="80" height="80" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some needs noticed during the procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ways to allow the doctor to see both the screen of the ultrasound and the bronchoscope camera’s screen. Similar to the problem during the transbronchial biopsy (when the physician could not see both the x-ray and bronchoscope screens and consequently had to move them during the procedure), it was impossible for the the fellow to see both screen and when looking at the EBUS screen, had to turn his head completely making it hard to coordinate the bronchoscope in his hand simultaneously.</li>
<li>A bronchoscope controller with more than 1 axis of rotation. Below is a picture (found on the internet) of the bronchoscope controller that the doctors use, it allows them to curl the scope up/forward or down/backward (green arrow), however is the doctor wanted to turn to the left or right (red arrow) to see maybe a mass on the left lung wall, then he would have to turn his entire arm in an awkward and slightly difficult manner.                                                    <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-24-at-1.25.23-AM-1.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-24-at-1.25.23-AM-1-80x80.png" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a> vs  <a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-24-at-1.52.31-AM.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-24-at-1.52.31-AM-80x80.png" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a>              I think a video game controller style stick would not only give them an easy access because of the two axis but it would also be more familiar.</li>
<li>A way or system to determine patient sedation or discomfort for minor procedures that don’t require an anesthesiologist .</li>
<li>Design a better structure for the space (or a new and larger room completely) to fit all machines while allow all persons access to the patient and see the screens for educational purposes as well. </li>

There’s nothing particular about that clinic or its doctors as it is seeing patients. Every time we walk into a patients room, the doctor opens the door first and says something like “I have some students who are here to learn is it ok for them to join us?” and I cringe hoping they say yes but also hoping that they&#8217;d feel comfortable enough to say no. My nerves are completely unsupported since every time each patient has responded yes, often times they respond with an,<em> of course!</em></p>
<p>At the sleep clinic on Friday, after observing last Friday, one of the fellows had us split into groups and actually ask the patients about their medical history and symptoms alone, to then give him a sort of debrief to make the appointments faster. I was so anxious, observing appointments was one thing but actually interacting with the patients was a lot of pressure. I was worried I’d forget what to ask, or respond in the wrong way, making a patient feel uncomfortable. I also worried that a patient would question who I was and why I was there, I had already stumbled into awkward explanations of why a bioengineer was in the hospital and didn’t want that to effect their responses. However, to my surprise the patients were all very welcoming to my questions and besides a patient who refused to see anyone but the doctor because she had been waiting for so long, the other group had the same experience. Here I realized the value of this opportunity being in a university setting instead of a private practice. From the first day, almost everyone we’ve met has taught us something, many doctors go out of their way to draw us diagrams, teach us equations and even interact with the patients to put ourselves in their shoes. Last week the doctor had us listen to a patient’s breathing to allow us to see the process he goes through when diagnosing, this worried me again since I had never held a stethoscope before and I wondered if the patient would mind, but he was so supportive of us learning that he too encouraged us.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This is a teaching institution,</em>” we constantly hear in the hospital, “<em>Everyone has to start somewhere.</em>”</p>
<p>Overall, this week flew bye, I cannot believe we are more than half way through the program and are supposed to be designing something. This experience has become way more hands on than I ever expected, and I am so thankful for all the doctors, residents, nurses, technicians and patients who helped cultivate this experience. The teaching I’ve observed in the hospital (not just to us, but also doctor to fellow to resident to student) creates a beautiful environment unique to what I’ve experienced in school or at work, it’s challenging (since you can get questioned on anything at anytime) but motivating and makes me excited to join the medical process.</p>

I realized that this was an unique opportunity to kind of address the problems they run into daily, after all they have been in the hospital much longer than we and are part of the users that we are designing for. With a few simple questions, we began an informal group interview and by the end of it my notepad was full of complaints and criticisms.</p>
<p>Here are some of the major things we were hearing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Large medical devices are being stored in the ICU hallways.</em> They feel this makes the ICU clustered and compromises the device&#8217;s sterility while there are better rooms they feel they should be stored in.</li>
<li> <em>MICU</em> <em>Delirium. </em>This is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of their environment (Mayo Clinic) and causes stress on the patients as well as the staff, making it harder to care for the and can (should be) minimized.</li>
<li><em>Cerner.</em> This is the system that the hospital uses for all things electronic, there were many complaints about it, including the new 12-character password which took up time when logging in.</li>
<li><em>Missing supplies.</em> There are floor-specific supplies for each unit, however when a patient from one unit is being treated on a different floor, physicians are supposed to retrieve supplies from the patient&#8217;s original floor. However, because of time and convenience many doctors will just take supplies from the floor their on which causes a shortage of supplies for that unit.</li>
<li><em>More computer space</em>. Things (paperwork) could go a lot faster if residents had two computer screens or a larger screen where they could have two windows up at the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>During these conversations I found myself  feeling overwhelmed by the systematic hospital issues. It was hard to narrow in on something we can actually help with, all of these problems felt out of my reach. Consequently, I began to move away from looking at the giant system of problems and go back to our observations. Although the residents, hospital staff and other &#8220;users&#8221; have a string of complaints, sometimes it&#8217;s the details that go unnoticed or are overlooked, that cause the issues they see. </p>
<p>Because of the advancement of technology as well as the societal, cultural and environmental changes over the years, sometimes the way things have been is no longer the most efficient way to do things. These past few weeks I recognize the nature of teaching from student to intern to resident to fellow and to attending is to follow and mimic techniques, habits, etc., exactly as they&#8217;re taught. For this reason, I feel extremely lucky to have such an opportunity, where I am able to come in, without a medical background, and replace various <em>&#8220;that&#8217;s just how it is&#8221;</em> with procedural questions.</p>

<div style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">I learned during the mornings in the MICU and afternoons in the clinic that everyone hates paperwork, yet we all have to do it. Nurses have to document every single symptom and vital, residents write up treatments and post op notes, pharmacists write up prescription details, doctors have to look over and approve care plans, and I have to write this blog. Documenting your day to day activities should be easy, after all you’re only putting words to your day, except it’s more complicated than that. For the medical team, documenting takes thought as the doctor must update every patient detail (many times from memory, occasionally from notes), information that is orally expressed in a minute may take many more minutes to write up.</div>
<div style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">In the hospital and clinic alike I observed doctors spending a significant amount of their time on paper work, mostly in the fellows room. Some doctors will type up notes while in the room with the patient, I think this is a wise way to save time, however during visits like this, the physician makes less eye contact and I find they ask less perceptive questions, overall it saves time but takes away from the patient experience.</div>
<div style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">Tuesday at the clinic one of the doctors expressed that the paperwork was a hassle, doctors are already pressed for time due to the back to back patient schedule which allots them 10 minutes per patient (30 min for new patients) and because each visit requires its own set of documentation, that time is actually less.</div>
<div style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">Here are two possible solutions I see and their barriers:</div>
<ul>
<li style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">Medical scribes are people hired to transcribe the patients information for the physician, giving them more time. Medical scribes can be an extra expense that a hospital/clinic cannot afford.</li>
<li style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">Speech recognition software such as Dragon will type as the physician speaks. However this software is commonly mistaken and fixing error can be just as time consuming as with out the program</li>
</ul>
<div style="color: #000000;font-family: HelveticaNeue;font-size: 12px;text-align: left">While I’ve seen that there are times when the doctors and nurses would like to just rid the world of charting, they are also thankful for it, like when they are reviewing a patient’s medical history, or when a patient forgets what medication he/she are taking. I’m not sure if this is a problem we can necessarily fix, but it is an issue that I believe should be addressed, especially in the medical field where time is not only money but can also be a matter of life and death.</div>

<p>Walking into the MICU that morning, my first thought was that someone died, why else would there be 20 doctors, nurses and pharmacists in the hallway? This was rounds. Rounds are like this:                                                                                                There are two teams of maybe 5-7 residents and interns, one team worked the floor over night and therefore has all the new patients, the other team came in around 6 am to do “pre-rounds” for their patients. There are 2 fellows who oversee both teams and an attending doctor who is scheduled to lead rounds that week. There is also a couple of pharmD students with their leading pharmacist and nurses near by. Everyone is holding a packet of information on all the patients and their vitals. The whole group moves together from door to door “rounding” the floor. A resident or intern will present the patients case to the attending while others listen and take notes, the attending then sort of quizzes the group on what they think should be done, and everyone sort of puts their medical knowledge together to create a plan of action, kind of like a Grey’s Anatomy episode. Then the attending and as many of the residents that can fit, go into the room, check the patient again, and update the patient of their health and decide how to move forward moving forward. </p>
<div style="width: 96px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-07-at-7.27.03-PM.png"><img class="attachment-thumbnail " src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-07-at-7.27.03-PM-80x80.png" width="86" height="86" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rounds; part of the team is in the patient’s room at this point</p></div>
<p>This takes about 2 hours for the entire floor. The last half hour, everyone meets in the fellow’s room (no there are not enough chairs or space for everyone) and goes over every patient again, this time looking at x-rays, CT-scans and other tests. After this the doctor leaves, the teams split up and again review patients and their next steps (updating dosages, planning procedures/surgeries, etc.)</p>
<div style="width: 90px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19046962_1422989881072865_1519017862_n.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail " src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19046962_1422989881072865_1519017862_n-80x80.jpg" width="80" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The “fellow’s room” &#8211; after rounds</p></div>
<p>To me, rounds were the coolest thing. Even though I spent most of the morning trying to decode their medical jargon, which sounded like a completely different language, I admired the way each member of the team came together, using their background to help the patient. It was like watching some kind of sports’ game, each part of the team needed each other; the residents needed the nurses, who only have about 1 or 2 patients, to understand each patient’s condition and then worked with the attending to come up with a plan, helping him see every patient faster, while the pharmacists assisted with drugs and dosage decisions, as well as giving important information on their side effects. Finally the nurses were updated on patient treatment and pulled the show together. Every patient felt like a mystery and every solution a miracle.</p>
<p>Many parts of the round process felt repetitive, like the attending and residents asking the same questions, or the team reviewing the same person for the 3rd time, but the attending, Dr. Dudek, explained it like this, “There are multiple levels of redundancies which we need.” Going over and over the patients is the only way the doctors can be sure they aren’t missing anything and is a seemingly extensive but necessary process to prevent error. </p>
<p>One question bothered me, <em>why do rounds at 8 am?</em></p>
<p>Rounds begin when the doctor arrives at 8am, therefore the interns must be there at 6:30 am to do pre-rounds, meaning the nurses and technician have to start checking vitals and run test at 4:30am to be ready for the residents. This means that not only are patients disturbed by the constant MICU alarms, they are also woken up in the middle of the night for these tests and again in the early morning for the doctor<i>. </i>This causes the patients agitation and stress, and overall loss of sleep, which effects even a healthy person.<em> So why rounds at 8 am</em>? It&#8217;s because making interns work longer than 28 hour shifts is illegal, and since the overnight team arrived the day before at 6:30am for the pre-rounds, legally they have to leave at 11am the next morning. Our readings have been focused on teaching us to design things “user-centered”. When I apply this to the hospital, or more specifically the MICU, I think we can make them “user-centered” by scheduling rounds considering the patients. Here is an area I think should be looked at systematically, along with the loud noises and constant MICU alarms, to be revised which has potential to benefit the patients experience and health tremendously. </p>

<p style="text-align: left">Walking into the clinic is very different than walking into a hospital. At first, the rooms and hallways give a warmer vibe, I realized the beige/yellowish colors on the walls and many windows allow natural light to fill the room. Additionally the clinic is less crowded than the hospital, and decreasing patient/doctor traffic, this changed the mood completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We spent Thursday morning in the pulmonary hypertension clinic located in the UIC outpatient care center. We began in the fellow’s room similar to the one at the hospital; a small room, lined with computers, where the doctors overviewed patients. Unlike the hospital, the clinic operates around a certain pattern. The patient begins with the medical assistant, who takes their vitals and relays this back to the fellow (or nurse practitioner) via bulletin board, who is in the meantime reviewing the patients history and test. Then the fellow sees the patient and conducts the appointment. After the fellow has gather all information they present the case to the attending and review the patients chest exams (X-ray, CT-scan, echocardiogram, etc.) as well as diagnosis together. Finally the doctor visits the patient, checking the same things the fellow has, as well as asking similar follow up questions, and determines the plan of care with the patient.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We were given the opportunity to observe the fellow and doctor during to the appointments and I remember feeling a bit odd at first, like our presence was intrusive. However almost all of the patients were welcoming and kind, we got lots of “good luck’’’s and thank you’s (even though we were the grateful ones!). It was interesting to learn about pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) from so many angles of different patients. Because it is a very specific, uncommon condition, I was surprised to see so many patients at the clinic with PAH and also saddened to see that many of them dealt with several other chronic health problems in addition to that. During one visit, the doctor suspected PAH and wanted to conduct a procedure (probably a right heart catheterization) to confirm so that he could begin treatment and slow down the progressive PAH, however the patient admitted that she did not want the procedure right away, she had gone through several other surgeries that year as was overrun. Although the doctor suggested otherwise, the action of care can only go as far as the patient wants, and I realized the patients who take initiative in caring for their health are generally healthier, however as they begin to juggle more complications, it just gets harder to persist with the same amount of fervency. </p>
<p style="text-align: left">Although I find the frenetic pace of the Medical ICU is more my style, the clinic was very straight forward, and allowed more patient interaction, which was a nice break.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> The Sleep Clinic</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Friday afternoon, we did a rotation to the Sleep clinic, which is about a 15 minute walk from the hospital. The sleep clinic resembled the previous one in structure and ambience, however it was unlike any clinical setting I have been in before. Each room had a large hotel-style bed, covered with homey blankets, monitored with a surveillance camera, an intercom, and sensors for the patients to monitor their vitals, as shown below: </p>
<div style="width: 148px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18987590_1422099087828611_1922003263_o-1.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  " src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18987590_1422099087828611_1922003263_o-1-80x80.jpg" width="138" height="138" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(ECG, EKG, EMG, CEMG)</p></div>
<p>These rooms were used to study sleep apnea, narcolepsy, insomnia, hypersomnia, and many other sleep disorders. There are many layers to a diagnosis of a sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, I found that a big part of the doctors job is understanding what is normal for the patient and what may not be but the patient accepts as normal. Below is a sample self exam called the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, used to gage sleep abnormalities a patient may overlook when asked about “how tired&#8221; they’ve been.</p>
<p><a href="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18986243_1422098927828627_782046842_o.jpg"><img class="attachment-thumbnail  aligncenter" src="https://clinicalimmersion.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18986243_1422098927828627_782046842_o-80x80.jpg" alt="" width="118" height="118" /></a></p>
<p>While this is no where near a final diagnosis of anything, I encourage you to out yourself in the patients place or try it for fun. 0-10 is a pretty normal score, while it is higher for teenagers, high scores can mean a number of things and I would not suggest jumping to any conclusions.</p>
<p>Each case we followed here was different and interesting, the fellows here were great, demonstrative teachers and I really enjoyed learning about sleep medicine, I am excited to spend more time here.</p>

In a small room, lined with computers side-by-side, we were introduced to some of the fellows, residents and attending doctors we would be working with for the next 6 weeks. This workspace, I noticed, is where communication from doctor to doctor happened, conversations were fast and full of information, part of me was amazed to see them in a matter of minutes, discuss several different patients and procedures without taking note or even getting confused.</p>
<p>Our fellow discussed a bronchoscopy that we were going to watch him do and after a brief introduction, we were ready to go. We stepped into a standard hospital size room, with a cart holding the equipment and a computer screen on one side, a portable x-ray (c-arm) with it’s screen on the other and a procedure bed in the middle, and a screen hanging above the foot of the bed. We waited for 15 minutes while the patient was being prepped for the procedure in another room, which was not what I expected. During this time, the bronchoscope technician ran back and forth from a GI procedure room to the patients’ room back to the pulmonary procedure room. He then walked the partially anesthetized patient to the room, where she was given more anesthesia and the procedure began. The tech assisted the doctor as a long, flexible scope with a digital camera on it was inserted into the patients lungs. The video was shown on the screen in front of the doctor, as shown in the picture above, while a second doctor watched the x-ray images from a screen on the other side of the room. Midway through the procedure, the doctor at the x-ray could not see the other screen displaying the scope’s camera and so the tech moved the screen, this is something I felt took time and compromised sterility, I felt it could be easily solved by adding an additional screen, or splitting the available screen. Impressively, the procedure was completed quickly almost under 30 minutes.</p>
<p>We watched 2 similar procedures later that day in the medical ICU where the all the same equipment was transported by cart to the patient’s bedside, I found this to be convenient for both the patient’s comfort and the doctors time. The final procedure was a tracheostomy, for a patient who had been living on a ventilator. The doctors had originally planned to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) at the same time, but made the “cardinal mistake of checking the patient’s history,” one doctor joked, and because the patient had a recent stomach bleed, decided against it in the best interest of the patient. The doctor did not intentionally discover this, but happened to read the patients history minutes before the PEG was scheduled.</p>
<p>A common theme among the doctors, residents, nurses and techs was that they were all juggling multiple engagements, quickly moving from tasks and spaces. While retentiveness, organization and a sort of balance are expected in this field, the amount of business and stress led to some confusing moments of miscommunication, which I felt could be problematic. I noticed during the first procedure, when the doctor in passing told the tech to set up for a transbronchial biopsy which he had no idea about until moments before getting the patient. This seemed like a familiar form of communication between the team, which works if the doctor happens to “catch” the tech in time (or vice versa) however if not, this leaves room for a lack in communication which can cause confusion, wasted time, and/or additional stress. I observed a small example of this during the first bronchoscopy when the doctor brought a tube for blood collection in, and because of the lack of communication with the nurse, when she arrived, she experienced confusion and even asked us what the purpose of it was. As the procedure started, the team lost a little bit of time in figuring out who’s tube was what. A similar “in the nick of time” communication happened during the last procedure, which helped me to see the familiarity in the system, and possible room for change.</p>

Hi all! I am a rising bioengineering senior. I enjoy (and draw inspiration from) music, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, cookie dough ice cream and cats. Despite the many prospects of majors I have tried, I found that studying bioengineering has increased my scope of impact more than any other major. I plan to go on to medical school after completing my BS in BioE. I hope this experience, along with my major, will help me in my future career to identify where the present systems are lacking and bridge the gap between the medical needs of patients and biomedical resources.</p>
