    <p>UIC encourages prospective students to visit the campus. A preadmission information session is offered weekdays (excluding campus holidays), and is followed by an optional campus tour. In addition, preadmission information sessions and campus tours are available on selected Saturdays throughout the year.</p>
    <p>                  UIC Preview Days give prospective students an opportunity to tour campus, visit a residence hall, obtain information about campus housing and financial aid, and attend information sessions with academic advisors from each of UIC&rsquo;s undergraduate programs. <br />
    </p>
    <p>For dates and reservations, prospective students should consult the Office of Admissions and Records (OAR) website <a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/visit/">http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/visit/</a>.</p>
    <p>                  Refer to the <em><a href="http://www.uic.edu/uic/about/visit/campus-maps.shtml">Campus Map</a></em> and<em> Travel Directions and Visitor Parking</em> for instructions on how to reach the UIC campus or visit the UIC website <a href="http://www.uic.edu">http://www.uic.edu</a> for more information.<br />

<p><span class="clsSubHead"><a name="b" id="b"></a>Admissions Application  Procedures</span><a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/visit/"><br />
    </a>          </p>
<p> All undergraduate applicants who wish to attend UIC, must submit the Common  Application and UIC Supplement online. Please go to <a href="http://www.admissions.uic.edu/apply">www.admissions.uic.edu/apply</a> to start the application process. Applicants must also submit all supporting  documents and the required nonrefundable application fee (or application fee  waiver) by the appropriate deadline to ensure an application review. All  credentials presented for admission become the permanent property of the  University, cannot be subsequently released to the student or to another  individual or institution, and cannot be held for reconsideration of admission  to subsequent terms.<br />
<br />
All students should carefully read the application instructions.<br />
<br />
    For information about registration as a visitor/auditor,  see the <em><a href="https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/cat1315/ARE.shtml">Registering  and Enrolling in Courses at UIC</a></em> section of the catalog. </p>

  Minimum requirements for competence in English apply to all applicants. An applicant may establish competence in English by certifying that the following requirements have been fulfilled in a country where English is the official/native language and in a school where English is the primary language of instruction: (1) graduation from a secondary school with three units, or the equivalent, of English; or (2) successful completion of a minimum of two academic years of full-time study at the secondary school or college level immediately prior to the proposed date of enrollment in the University.<br />
      <br />
Applicants  who do not meet the above requirement may provide sufficient evidence of  competence in English by achieving a minimum TOEFL iBT score 80, with subscores  of Reading 19, Listening 17, Speaking 20, and Writing 21 on the TOEFL iBT<strong> OR</strong> a minimum IELTS score of 6.5, with subsection minimums as follows: listening 6,  writing 6, reading 6, speaking 6. The iBT (Internet-based Test of English as a  Foreign Language) is administered by the Educational Testing Service, <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl">http://www.ets.org/toefl</a>. Higher scores may  be required for some programs and colleges. This requirement may be waived by the managing  director of admissions and the dean of the college concerned if the applicant  can provide evidence of competence in English that will clearly justify a  waiver.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="f" id="f"></a>Transfer Applicant</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>A transfer applicant is one who (1)  has completed a minimum of 24 semester or 36 quarter hours of transferable  college classroom credit by the time of application and (2) does not meet the  definition of a first year applicant or a readmission applicant. While 24  semester or 36 quarter hours are the minimum number of hours required, most  curricula require additional credit hours and the completion of some specific  core first-year courses. For specific requirements in each curriculum at the  time of application and the time of enrollment, consult the undergraduate  application online<a href="../../depts/oar/undergrad/apply_undergrad.html"> http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/undergrad/apply_undergrad.html</a>. </p>
    <p><span class="clsSubHead3"> Illinois Articulation Initiative<br />
      </span>The Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) is a statewide agreement that allows transfer of the completed IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) between participating Illinois institutions. Successful completion of the GECC at any participating college or university in Illinois assures students that general education requirements for the baccalaureate degree have been satisfied. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is a participating university. <br />
  <br />
      IAI policies, including  GECC requirements, course codes and course descriptions, are presented on the  website <a href="http://www.itransfer.org">http://www.iTransfer.org </a>and UIC&rsquo;s implementation requirements are  published below. Students who transfer out of UIC will be held to the  requirements of their transfer institution.<span class="clsSubHead3"><br />
  <br />
  Eligibility<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Only transfer students entering UIC for the first time are eligible for IAI consideration. IAI policies do not apply to students who are readmitted to UIC or students who take courses elsewhere after enrolling at UIC. </li>
  <li>New transfer  students who enter UIC with the GECC completed will be considered to have  completed UIC&rsquo;s General Education requirements as defined in the <em>General  Education</em> section of the catalog. However, additional General  Education requirements that have been approved for specific UIC colleges may  still be required.  </li>
  <li>New transfer students with 30 hours of accepted transfer work who have not completed the GECC may consult with a college advisor to review options for completing General Education requirements. Depending on the number of remaining courses required a student may be allowed the option of completing either UIC&rsquo;s General Education program or the GECC. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Note</strong>:</strong> The GECC option is made available only when completion of the GECC requirements calls for at least two fewer courses than would be needed to complete UIC&rsquo;s General Education requirements. <br />
<br />
<strong>For students who complete the GECC prior to UIC enrollment</strong><br />
New transfer students who enter UIC with the GECC completed must meet with a college advisor to ensure that UIC General Education requirements are marked as fulfilled in the University&rsquo;s degree audit system. To assist with first-semester course selection at UIC, students should bring a copy of a community college or participating Illinois university transcript which includes a statement showing completion of the IAI GECC to the Transfer Orientation Program.<br />
<strong><br />
For students eligible to  complete the GECC at UIC</strong><br />
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
  <li>All accepted  transfer courses completed prior to enrollment at UIC which are identified on  the IAI website (<a href="http://www.itransfer.org">http://www.itransfer.org</a>)  with a corresponding GECC course code will be used to satisfy GECC  requirements. <br />
  </li>
  <li>GECC may be  completed by enrolling in approved IAI courses at UIC. <br />
  </li>
  <li>UIC policies on Credit by Examination (ACT/SAT, AP, IB, and CLEP) in the <em><a href="https://catalog.webhost.uic.edu/ucat/cat1315/AS.shtml">Academic Standing</a></em> section of the catalog will be used to determine credit used to satisfy GECC requirements. UIC will not award transfer course credit based on another institution&rsquo;s evaluation of test results.<br />
  </li>
  <li>If a student  satisfactorily fulfills the course requirements of a GECC area but earns fewer  hours than required, the remaining hours for that area may be waived by the  college dean. However, students must complete a minimum of 12 courses, a  minimum of 37 hours, and the minimum number of courses required in each area of  the GECC.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Transfer credit from a nonparticipating IAI institution is not acceptable to meet GECC requirements. <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><br />
  UIC&rsquo;s GECC Courses</strong><br />
  UIC courses approved for the IAI General Education Core  Curriculum are listed officially on the IAI website <a href="http://www.itransfer.org">http://www.iTransfer.org.</a><br />
  <br />
  <span class="clsSubHead3">Acceptance of Traditional Transfer Credit </span></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0">
  <li> Admission of transfer students to UIC is based  on the transfer course work that is similar in nature, content, and level to that offered by UIC. Such courses are normally referred to as transfer work. Other course work completed, such as technical courses similar in content and level to courses taught at the University, will be used in evaluation for admission only upon the request of the dean of the college to which the student seeks admission.</li>
  <li> Transfer  credit, as defined above, will be accepted at full value for admission purposes  on transfer to the University if earned at institutions of higher education as  defined below:
    <table width="669" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="bottom" scope="row">a.</td>
        <td>Colleges and universities that offer degree programs comparable to programs offered by UIC and are (1) members of, or hold Candidate for Accreditation status from, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools or other regional accrediting associations, or (2) accredited by another accrediting agency that is a member of the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation. </td>

      </tr>
      </table>
  </li>
  <li>Certain colleges and universities do not meet the specifications in 2 above but have been assigned a status by the University Committee on Admissions that permits credit to be accepted on a provisional basis for admission purposes on transfer to UIC. Transfer credit, as defined in 1 above, from such colleges and universities is accepted on a deferred basis to be validated by satisfactory completion of additional work in residence. Validation through satisfactory work in residence may be accomplished by earning at UIC or another fully accredited<span class="sup">a</span> college or university, at least a 2.00/4.00 or 3.00/5.00 grade point average (higher if prescribed by the curriculum the student wishes to enter) in the first 12 to 30 semester hours completed following transfer. <br />
  </li>
  <li> In all cases, the precise amount of transfer credit applicable toward a particular degree will be determined by the University, college, and department concerned after the student has been admitted. <br />

  Transfer Student Admission Requirements </span><br />
</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0;">
  
  <li>Complete and submit the Common Application Online along with the  UIC Supplement. Printed applications will not be accepted.</li>
  <li>Â Submit the $50  nonrefundable application fee.</li>
  <li>A transfer applicant must submit evidence of  having achieved a minimum transfer grade point average of 2.50/4.00 or 3.50/5.00  on the basis of all transferable work attempted and submit evidence of having  completed a minimum of 24 semester or 36 quarter hours of transferable college  classroom credit at the time of application. However, most colleges and  departments require a higher minimum grade point average, additional credit  hours, and the completion of some specific core, first-year courses. For  specific information on the requirements for each college, consult the Office of Admissions website <a href="../../depts/oar/prospective_students/index.html">http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/prospective_students/index.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For       admission purposes, transfer grades for all baccalaureate-oriented course       work attempted and accepted are used in computing the transfer student&rsquo;s       average. However, a particular UIC college or school may not accept all       courses toward degree requirements. </li>
  <li>A transfer       applicant who was previously dismissed from a collegiate institution for       disciplinary or academic reasons must submit a petition to the Managing       Director of Admissions, who will forward the petition to the appropriate       committee. </li>
  <li>When a       course is repeated the grade point average is computed using both grades       and all hours for the course. However, credit for the course is only       awarded once. </li>
  <li>Incomplete       grades more than one year old are considered as failing grades in       computing the grade point average. </li>
  <li>Only course       work that is similar in nature, content, and level to that offered by UIC       is acceptable. </li>
  <li>Technical,       vocational, developmental, and remedial course work generally is not       transferable. </li>
  <li>Courses from       other postsecondary institutions must have been completed at the       appropriate level to be transferable. </li>
  <li>Credit for       nontraditional experiential prior learning is not transferable. </li>
  <li>Applicants       enrolled in another college at the time they plan to apply to UIC should       request a transcript from their current institution including a list of       the courses they are taking at the beginning of the last term they are       enrolled. (Fall applicants currently attending a quarter-based school       should apply at the beginning of their winter term.) A final transcript       should be sent to UIC as soon as possible after the final term is       completed. </li>
</ol>
<p>International  applicants must satisfy additional requirements to be considered for admission.  Information pertaining to the additional requirements is available in the  following section titled <em><a href="#j">International  Applicant</a></em>.<br />
  <br />
  Admission is competitive, and preference is given to those applicants selected  to have the best potential for academic success at UIC.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="fa" id="fa"></a>Intercampus Transfer Applicant </span><br />
    Undergraduate intercampus transfers among the University of Illinois at Chicago, at Springfield, and at Urbana-Champaign may be admitted to another campus provided (1) they meet the requirements of the program, (2) there is space available in the program, and (3) they submit the application and credentials by the application deadline.<br />
    <br />
    Students who are currently enrolled and who are applying to one of the other campuses for the immediately succeeding semester do not pay an application fee. &ldquo;Immediately succeeding semester&rdquo; may mean either the spring semester if the applicant completed the fall semester at the other campus, or it may mean the summer or fall term, provided the applicant completed the spring semester at the other campus.<br />
    <br />
      <span class="clsSubHead2"><a name="g" id="g"></a>Readmission Applicant<br />
      </span>Readmission applicants are former UIC  students who were registered as degree-seeking undergraduates and who left the  University for two or more semesters in succession (summer session excluded).  Readmission applicants are considered for readmission on the basis of their  status at the time they left the University, any college work they have  completed elsewhere since their last attendance at the University, and the  availability of space in the chosen program. Degree-seeking readmission  applicants do not pay the application fee.<br />
  <br />
  Students who interrupt their UIC enrollment by 24 months or two academic years  in succession (summer session excluded) must reapply. <br />
  <br />
  Former UIC students who left the University on academic dismissal status,  regardless of whether they have attended another collegiate institution in the  interval, must submit a petition with an application when they apply for  readmission. Admission is granted upon approval of the dean of the college  concerned and of the Managing Director of Admissions.<br />
  <br />
  Former students who left the University on probation, or who left UIC on clear  status but have attended another collegiate institution where they have earned  an academic GPA below 2.00/4.00, may be readmitted to the University only with a  petition approved by the dean of the college concerned.</p>
<p>A former UIC  student who was dismissed for disciplinary reasons must submit a petition to  the Managing Director of Admissions, who will forward it to the appropriate  committee.<br />

  Students who do not presently wish to enroll in a degree program at UIC, but who wish to take courses for credit may apply for nondegree status.
  During the fall and spring semesters, acceptance of a  student in nondegree status is at the discretion of the dean of the college to  which the student is applying. Nondegree applicants for fall and spring  semesters must meet all regular admission requirements and complete a current  Undergraduate Application, available online <a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/applyonline/undergrad">http://www.uic.edu/depts/oar/applyonline/undergrad</a>. <br />

</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"> A  student who wishes to take undergraduate courses at UIC during the <em>summer  only</em> and who does not intend to continue at UIC in the fall may apply as a  Summer Session Only student. Typical Summer Session Only students include  students enrolled in degree programs at other colleges or universities who are  in the Chicago area for the summer. Individuals who have already completed  undergraduate degrees but need to take undergraduate-level courses to fill  deficiencies in preparation for advanced study may also apply as Summer Session  Only students.<br />
  <br />
Prospective Summer Session Only students must complete a Summer Session Only  Application, available onlineÂ <a href="http://summer.uic.edu/">http://summer.uic.edu/</a>.<br />
<br />
Students who wish to attend UIC in the summer and continue in the fall or  spring semester need to submit a Summer Session Only application for the summer  and the Common Application and UIC Supplement, along with providing the  required credentials, for the later term. Each application must be submitted by  the appropriate deadline for the specific term of admission.</p>
